            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There is the happineſſe of the left hand, which is <hi>Civill,</hi> in the firſt clauſe of the words; and the happineſſe of the right, which is <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> in the ſecond. Anſwerable to theſe are the two welcome aſpects of this day: the <hi>Civill</hi> aſpect or reference, which ariſeth from the annuall revolution, as it is <hi>Dies Principis,</hi> a day of ſolemnitie for the honour of the King: and the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> aſpect from the weekly revolution, as it is <hi>Dies Dominica,</hi> a day of devotion for the worſhip of God. In theſe there is ſo evident a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that I cannot but congratulate, both the day to the text, and the text to the day, in regard
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114893:9"/>of their mutuall complications. For we have, on the one ſide, both clauſes of the text in the day: and on the other, both references of the day in the text. <hi>Happineſſe</hi> is the language of all: and, that which addes to the contentment, it is Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with an Echo, or ingemination; <hi>Happy</hi> and <hi>Happy.</hi> From this ingemination ariſe the parts of the text; the ſame which are the parts both of the greater world and the leſſe. As the heaven and earth in the one, and the body and the ſoul in the other: ſo are the paſſages of this Scripture in the two veins of Happineſſe. We may range them as Iſaac doth the two parts of his bleſſing, Gen. 27. The vein of civill happineſſe,
<note place="margin">Gen. 27.28.</note> in <hi>the fatneſſe of the earth:</hi> and the vein of Divine happineſſe, in <hi>the dew of heaven.</hi> Or (if you will have it out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel) here's Marthaes portion in the <hi>many things</hi> of the body:
<note place="margin">Luke 10.41, 42.</note> and Maries better part in the <hi>Vnum neceſſarium</hi> of the ſoul. To give it yet more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, here's the path of <hi>Proſperity</hi> in Outward comforts; <hi>Happy is the people that is in ſuch a caſet</hi> and the path of <hi>Piety</hi> in comforts Spirituall; <hi>Yea, happy is that people which have the</hi> LORD <hi>for their God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of the firſt, without any further ſubdiviſion, I will onely ſhew what it is the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt treats of: and that ſhall be, by way of Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in theſe three particulars. It is <hi>De</hi> FELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CITATE; <hi>De Felicitate</hi> POPULI; <hi>De</hi> HAC <hi>felicitate populi:</hi> Of <hi>happineſſe;</hi> Of the <hi>peoples</hi> happineſſe; Of the peoples happineſſe, as <hi>in ſuch a caſe.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Happineſſe</hi> is the generall, and the firſt: a noble argument, and worthy of an inſpired pen, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Pſalmiſts. Of all other there can be none better to ſpeak of <hi>popular</hi> happineſſe, then ſuch a <hi>King:</hi> nor of <hi>celeſtiall,</hi> then ſuch a <hi>Prophet.</hi> Yet I mean not to diſcourſe of it in the full latitude, but only as it hath a peculiar poſiture in this Pſalme, very various and different from the order of other pſalmes. In this Pſalme it is reſerved to the <hi>end,</hi> as the cloſe of the foregoing meditations: In other Pſalmes it is ſet in the <hi>front,</hi> or firſt place of all; as in the 32, in the 112, in the 119, and in the 128. Again, in this the Pſalmiſt ends with <hi>our</hi> bleſſedneſſe, and begins with <hi>God's;</hi> BLESSED BE THE LORD MY STRENGTH. In the 41 Pſalme, contrary, he makes his <hi>exordium</hi> from <hi>mans;</hi> BLESSED IS HE THAT CONSIDERETH THE POOR: his <hi>concluſion</hi> with <hi>God's;</hi> BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SED BE THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerve theſe variations, becauſe they are helpfull to the underſtanding both of the <hi>eſſence,</hi> and <hi>ſplendour</hi> of true happineſſe. To the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>eſſence</hi> they help, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate how our own happineſſe is enfolded in the glory of God, and ſubordinate unto it. As we cannot begin with <hi>Beatus,</hi> unleſſe we end with <hi>Benedictus:</hi> ſo we muſt begin with <hi>Benedictus,</hi> that we may end with <hi>Beatus.</hi> The reaſon is this, Becauſe the glory of God it is as well the <hi>conſummation,</hi> as the <hi>introduction</hi> to a Chriſtians happineſſe. Therefore as in the other Pſalm he begins below, and ends upwards: ſo in this, having
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114893:10"/>begun from above with that which is principall, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord;</hi> he fixeth his ſecond thoughts upon the ſubordinate, <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> or <hi>happy are the people.</hi> He could not proceed in a better order: he firſt looks up to <hi>Gods</hi> kingdome, then reflects upon his <hi>own;</hi> as not meaning to <hi>take</hi> bleſſedneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had <hi>given it.</hi> There is no man can think, but this is the beſt method. It is the method of Saints, as we ſee 1. Sam. 25.32, 33. and 2. Chron. 31.8. Firſt, <hi>Bleſſed be the God of Iſrael;</hi> then, <hi>Bleſſed be the people of Iſrael.</hi> Nay, it is the method of Angels:
<note place="margin">Luke 2.14.</note> they firſt ſing, <hi>Glorie to God;</hi> then, <hi>Good will towards men.</hi> It muſt alſo be the method of every Chriſtian, whenſoever we are about the wiſhing of bleſſedneſſe, either to our ſelves or others, to begin from heaven, and aſcribe it firſt to the LORD. That we may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> we muſt <hi>give:</hi> give what we <hi>have,</hi> and give what we <hi>mean to have.</hi> To <hi>give</hi> is the way to <hi>get:</hi> both to get the <hi>thing,</hi> and to get the <hi>greater degree.</hi> It is an undeniable conſequence, If beatitude be the ultimate end of man, and the glorie of God the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end of our very beatification; then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes neceſſarily, That by giving more glorie to God we gain more of beatitude to our ſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more of the ſupreme and beatificall end. So that he who will attain to the Pſalmiſt's <hi>comfort,</hi> muſt obſerve alſo the Pſalmiſt's <hi>order:</hi> that he may <hi>end</hi> aſſuredly with BEATUS, he muſt learn to <hi>begin</hi> with BENEDICTUS. That's the firſt conſiderable thing in the order as touching the <hi>eſſence</hi> of true happineſſe. The other is concerning the <hi>ſplendour,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114893:10"/>which flowes from the other part of the variation: in that the Pſalmiſt doth end this pſalme, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins divers of the reſt, with <hi>Happy</hi> or <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> to repreſent, as it were, unto us <hi>utramqueſplendoris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginam,</hi> the two great excellencies of bleſſedneſſe by the double ſituation of it. Happineſſe is both the <hi>bonum Primum,</hi> and the <hi>bonum Vltimum,</hi> of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: the <hi>ſpring</hi> of all good things, and the <hi>crown:</hi> the <hi>ſpire,</hi> and the <hi>baſis:</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> of things to be deſired; the firſt for <hi>eminence,</hi> the laſt for <hi>fruition.</hi> In the <hi>deſcents</hi> of Chriſtianitie the firſt, becauſe we move from it to inferiour ends: happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe giveth law to all our actions; we move from it, that we may in time come to the poſſeſſion of it. In the order of <hi>aſcent</hi> it is the laſt: for having climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once thither, we go no further, but ſet up our reſt. It hath this reſemblance with God himſelf, who is the Donour of it, That it is both the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the end, before which nothing ſhould be loved, and after which nothing can be deſired. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to theſe two reſpects are the poſitures of happineſſe in the Pſalmes. As in military affairs, it is the cuſtome of Emperours to promiſe the Donative to their ſouldiers when they go forth to warre, that they may encourage them; but not to give it till the warre be ended, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them for their ſervice: In like manner (ſaith S. Ambroſe) doth the Pſalmiſt: <hi>velut praeco magni Imperatoris,</hi> he diſpoſeth of beatitude both wayes: he prefixeth it to the beginning of ſome Pſalmes, that thereby we might be invited to pietie; he annexeth it to the end of others, to teach us not to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114893:11"/>look for it before our work be done. So even by this we may learn how to order and diſpoſe of our ſelves to happineſſe. Since it hath the <hi>double refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> it muſt have alſo the <hi>double honour,</hi> and the <hi>double esteem,</hi> yea and our <hi>double endeavours</hi> for the attaining of it. Then we give it the <hi>double,</hi> when we ſet it in <hi>both</hi> places, make it both our <hi>firſt</hi> and our <hi>laſt,</hi> the <hi>prime</hi> of our life, and the <hi>perſeverance.</hi> We muſt look through all things upon happineſſe, and through happineſſe upon all: through all upon it, as not reſting in any thing elſe; and through it upon all, as ſeaſoning every act of our life with the thought of happineſſe. Otherwiſe, if we think to give it our laſt reſpects without our firſt, pretend what we will, there is no hope to overtake it. Thus farre even worldly men will go: they are willing enough to heare that they muſt make it their laſt work, and they fulfill it in a ſort to the <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but not to the <hi>meaning.</hi> The love, the hope, the care of their own happineſſe, they put them off all to the laſt: A very prepoſterous courſe for a man to begin where and when he ſhould have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to defer his firſt of motion to his laſt of reſt. It is too late for the fooliſh Virgins to cry,
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord open</hi> when the doore is ſhut: and a vain thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect happineſſe as our end, unleſſe we make it our beginning, and give it the ſame place in our hearts and actions, which holy David affords it in his meditations: the firſt place in other Pſalmes, as the beſt introduction to all other diſcourſes; the laſt in this, as a delightfull farwell to be alwayes freſh in remembrance. That ſhall ſerve for the firſt ſtep of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114893:11"/>the Gradation, the <hi>generall</hi> part of the argument handled: It is <hi>De</hi> FELICITATE.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is more <hi>ſpeciall:</hi> it is <hi>defelicitate Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li;</hi> HAPPY, or, BLESSED ARE THE PEOPLE. In the former part of the Pſalme he ſpeaks of ſuch things as concern his <hi>own</hi> happineſſe; <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord</hi> MY <hi>ſtrength,</hi> verſ. 1. <hi>Send down from above, and ſave</hi> ME <hi>out of the great waters,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>Rid</hi> ME <hi>and deliver</hi> ME <hi>from the hand of ſtrange children,</hi> verſ. 11. And he might as eaſily have continued the ſame ſtrain in the clauſes following, <hi>That</hi> MY <hi>ſonnes may grow up as the young plants,</hi> MY <hi>daughters may be as the poliſhed corners of the temple,</hi> MY <hi>ſheep fruitfull,</hi> MY <hi>oxen ſtrong,</hi> MY <hi>garners full and plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> and accordingly he might have concluded it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Happy ſhall I be, if I be in ſuch a caſe.</hi> This, I ſay, he might have done, nay, this he would have done, if his deſires had reflected onely upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But being of a diffuſive heart, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what belonged to the neighbourhoods of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as loth to enjoy this happineſſe alone, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters his ſtyle, and (being in the height of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhes to himſelf) he turns the ſingular into a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>Our ſheep, Our oxen, Our garners, Our ſonnes and daughters;</hi> that he might compendiate all in this, <hi>Happy are the people.</hi> Here's a true teſtimonie both of a religious and generous mind, who knew in his moſt retired thoughts to look out of himſelf, and to be mindfull of the publick welfare in his privateſt meditations. S. Ambroſe obſerves it as a clear cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a noble ſpirit, to do what tends to the publick good, though to his own diſadvantage:

But (alas!) there are few ſuch ſpirits in our time: It is a rare thing to find a private man, who cordially devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelf to the good of the Communitie.

There is hardly any man to be found, whoſe bent is not towards himſelf: Whereas the publick is the private infinitely multiplied; and ſo much the more of nearer concernment, as it is of larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion: whereas again man is onely a world in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative ſenſe of ſpeaking, and that but a micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme or little world, that is in effect, a ſmall part of the great; yet, as in ſome other things, ſo in this alſo it falls out, The <hi>Allegorie</hi> devoures the <hi>letter,</hi> the <hi>private</hi> eats up the <hi>publick,</hi> the <hi>part</hi> the <hi>whole,</hi> the overweaning reſpect to the <hi>little world</hi> doth every where almoſt overturn the <hi>greater.</hi> I know there are many which make fair ſhews, goodly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, great oſtentation of the contrary: You ſhall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114893:12"/>have them often crying out, <hi>The Publick, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi> and as faſt as the Jews did, <hi>The Temple, the Temple:</hi> but it is with the like inſincerity; for their aim is wholly for themſelves. So we ſhew our ſelves hypocrites even in things civill, as well as in religion. Each godly man is of another tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. His word is that of S. Ambroſe, <hi>Mihi parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, foris totus:</hi> or that of the Oratour in Saluſt, <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum en Caius Cotta, voveo, dedóque me pro Republica.</hi> It was a brave reſolution in a Heathen: but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us Chriſtians more. For he was onely a part of one Communitie: we, each of us have a ſhare in two; being members of the Church, as well as the State. So there is a double tie upon us: and that we ſhould daily remember it, it is inſinuated in the Lord's prayer: in which as there is one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe petition for the publick; ſo there is a reſpect had to it in all. There is nothing ſingular, not an <hi>I,</hi> nor a <hi>Me,</hi> nor a <hi>Mine;</hi> but all plurall, <hi>We, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, Our:</hi> noting that it is every mans duty, even in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to be zealous for the Communitie. But the text will not allow me that ſcope, to ſpeak of this zeal to the publick as 'tis the <hi>dutie</hi> of private men, but as it is an <hi>excellencie</hi> of Kings and Princes. It's true, I might call it a <hi>duty</hi> even in them alſo; God requires it of them as a <hi>duty:</hi> but it becomes us to repute it an <hi>excellencie,</hi> both becauſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is ours which redounds from thence, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe it is more eminent and illuſtrious in them, then in other men. In others it's <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>miniſteriall,</hi> in a Prince <hi>ſupreme</hi> and <hi>univerſall.</hi> He is the influxive head, who both governs the whole
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114893:13"/>bodie, and every member which is any way ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the bodie: The glorious Sunne that gives light both to the world, and to the ſtarres themſelves, which in their ſeverall ſtations are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the world. Here's enough to define it an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie,</hi> to have the care and truſt of the whole in himſelf. Yea but further, to tender it as himſelf, and to ſet the weal of the publick in equipage with his own happineſſe, and to fold them up together, his own in the publick and the publick in his own; is ſo high an aſcent of goodneſſe, that it were a great wrong to ſuch virtue, to ſtile it by any leſſe name then an <hi>excellencie.</hi> In this particular I might eaſily be large: but it requires not ſo much proofs, as acknowledgements and retributions. Therefore I will briefly proceed both wayes: and firſt give you a few examples for proofs; and then, I am ſure, there is no man ſo unworthy, but will think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to retributions. The firſt example ſhall be taken from Moſes: whom Philo reckons among Kings; and ſo doth the Scripture, Deut. 33.5. For howſoever he had not the <hi>name,</hi> he had the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authoritie:</hi> yet even in that power he was not more Regal, then in his tenderneſſe over the people. At one time his tenderneſſe was ſo great toward them, that becauſe he could not do them ſo much good as he deſired, he beſought the Lord to take away his life; Numb. 11.15. At another time he was ſo perplexed with the fear of their deſtruction, that he requeſted of God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keep them ſtill in the land of the living, or to blot him out of the book of life; Exod 32.32.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114893:13"/>hereby ſhewing himſelf not onely <hi>the miracle of Nature,</hi> as Philo calls him, but of Grace too, in pledging for them that which was more worth then his life, his very ſalvation. It was a rare ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample of Caſtor and Pollux, ſo highly magnified by Authours, That being twinnes, and (as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets feigned) one born mortall, the other immortall, Pollux (to ſhew his love to his brother) yielded ſo farre, as to take to himſelf a part of his brothers mortalitie, and to lend him as much of his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie: being better pleaſed to enjoy a half im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie with the good of his brother, then a whole one alone by himſelf. It is known by all to be a fiction: yet if it were true, it is farre ſhort of this proffer of Moſes. He knew full well what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to immortalitie, and to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this of Moſes I know no example ſo tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cending as that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet David: who (beſides that he urgeth it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every Pſalme, <hi>The peace of Jeruſalem, The ſalvation of Iſrael, The felicity of Gods choſen, The bleſsing of the people</hi>) in one place he argues for it even to his own deſtruction: You have it, 1. Chron. 21.16, 17. It is there recorded, that ſeeing the angel of the Lord with his ſword drawn over Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem to deſtroy it, he thus reaſons with God for the ſafeguard of the publick: <hi>Me, me; adſum qui
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114893:14"/>feci;</hi> IT IS I, EVEN I IT IS THAT HAVE SINNED: <hi>In me convertito ferrum;</hi> LET THY HAND BE AGAINST ME, AND AGAINST MY FATHERS HOUSE, NOT ON THY PEOPLE: FOR THESE SHEEP VVHAT HAVE THEY DONE? He that conſiders theſe words will hardly be able to tell what moſt to wonder at; the condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his love, or the overflowing. <hi>He declared here,</hi> ſaith S.

To lay down, as it were, his own royall neck under the ſword of the Angell, when he ſaw it hanging over him by a leſſe thrid, then that of Damocles: To open his own religious breaſt, to receive the blow, that he might ward it from the people: To value the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſafety ſo farre aboue his own, as to interpoſe himſelf betwixt the ſword and the ſlaughter: O how farre doth he here renounce himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, not onely from royalty, but from life it ſelf! It is much which is mentioned in the text, that he ſhould name the people firſt to the happineſſe: more, that he ſhould offer himſelf firſt to the puniſhment: very much, that he ſhould put the people betwixt himſelf and the bleſſing: farre more, that he ſhould place himſelf betwixt the people and the curſe. He made himſelf in this SPECULUM PRINCIPUM, <hi>the mirrour of Princes:</hi> a mirrour, into which (as we may well preſume) our Gracious Sovereigne King CHARLES hath made frequent and uſefull inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for it is manifeſt by many paſſages of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114893:14"/>reign and happy government, that the tenderneſſe of his love towards his people, if it doth not fully reach, yet it comes cloſe up to the receſſions of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. It is the more remarkable, for that he hath this virtue as it were in proper and by himſelf, he is almoſt the ſole poſſeſſour of it. The moſt of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men, as living more by <hi>will</hi> then <hi>reaſon,</hi> are all for holding: ſo ſtiffe and inflexible, ſo tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unyielding, even in matters of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that they will not ſtirre a hair-breadth. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them, perſuade them, convince them; ſtill they keep to this principle (and 'tis none of the beſt) O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of ſuch receſſions we have many inſtances in the courſe of his Majeſties government. I might go as farre back as his firſt coming to the Crown: when he receded from his own profit, in taking upon him the payment of his Fathers debts, which were great, and but ſmall ſupplies to be expected from an empty Exchequer: yet the love of juſtice and his peoples emolument overſwayed him, and armed him with Epaminondas his reſolution, <hi>Totius orbis divitias deſpicere, prae patriae charitate.</hi> Having but glanced at that, I might draw a little nearer to the third of his reign: when, in that Parliament of <hi>Tertio,</hi> he was pleaſed to ſigne the, ſo much deſired, Petition of Right: a Title which, I confeſſe, takes me much: both becauſe it ſpeaks the dutifulneſſe of the ſubject, in petitioning, although for right; and the great goodneſſe of a Gracious Prince,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114893:15"/>who knows how to recede from power, and in ſome caſe even from prerogative, when beſought by prayers; and rejoyceth, not to <hi>ſell</hi> his favours, but to <hi>give</hi> them. For I have heard ſome wiſe men ſay, That that ſingle grant was equivalent to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſubſidies. But the time will not give me leave to dwell, as I ſhould, upon particulars: therefore I will call you nearer to the tranſient remembrance (and but the tranſient, for it is no pleaſure to revive it) of the commotions in the North. The eyes of the whole world were upon that action, and they all are witneſſes what pains and travell were taken, what clemencie and indulgence was uſed, what yieldings and condeſcentions, both in point of honour and power, to purchaſe, as it were; by a price paid out of himſelf, the peace and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of both kingdomes. Whereby he made all men underſtand, how much more pleaſing it was to his Princely diſpoſition, with Cyrus in Xenophon, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and to conquer, not by <hi>might,</hi> but by <hi>clemency.</hi> By <hi>clemency,</hi> I ſay, the word which I named before, and I cannot name it too often. It is the virtue God moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in, to exerciſe himſelf; and 'tis the copie alſo which he ſets us to write after: It is the virtue which draws both eyes and hearts unto it; in that it maketh Royalty it ſelf, which is ſo farre above, to become beneficiall and ſovereign: It corrects the brightneſſe of Majeſtie, calmes the ſtrictneſſe of Juſtice, lightens the weight of Power, attempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates whatſoever might cauſe terrour to our mind and liking. If we never had known it before, yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114893:15"/>the onely time of this Parliament would teach us ſufficiently how much we ow to the King's cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie. The laws and ſtatutes which have been made this laſt year, are laſting and ſpeaking mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of thefe royall receſſions, as well to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, as to our ſelves. Surely if the true picture and reſemblance of a Prince be in his laws; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that in the acts, for trienniall Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, for the continuation of the Parliament now being, for the regulating of impoſitions, preſſing of ſouldiers, courts of Judicature, and others not a few of the like nature, are the lineaments, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to the life, of the perfect pourtraiture of a Benigne and Gracious Prince, who ſeems reſolved of a new way, and hitherto unheard of, by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome laws to <hi>enlarge his ſubjects,</hi> and to <hi>confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Yet it may be ſaid, It is not his onely hand which is in theſe laws: the <hi>propoſall</hi> of them is from others, although the <hi>ratification</hi> be in him. Be it ſo: But the ratification is ten-fold to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall; nay, it is the life and eſſence of a law. So we ow the laws themſelves to his goodneſſe. Nay, and if it be granted, that the propoſall of ſuch laws comes from others; let us then look to the many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meſſages, which occaſionally have been ſent, at ſeverall times, to that great Aſſemblie. In theſe he ſpeaks onely by himſelf; and in ſo gracious a manner, that to read ſome paſſages, would <hi>raviſh</hi> a loyall heart, as well as <hi>endear</hi> it. In ſome of them we may ſee, how he puts the happineſſe of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the ſame proximitie with his own: in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, how he neglects his own for our accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114893:16"/>In that of January the 20, you have theſe golden words: That he will rather lay by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpect of his Own dignity, then loſe time for the Publick good: That, out of his Fatherly care of his people, he will be ready, both to equall, and to exceed the greateſt examples of the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Princes, in their Acts of Grace and Favour to their people. Again, in that of the 28 of Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there is yet more tenderneſſe. He calls God to witneſſe (and with him the atteſtation of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred name is very religious) that the preſervation of the publick peace, the law and the libertie of the ſubject, is and ſhall alwayes be as much his care and induſtrie, as the ſafety of his own life, or the lives of his deareſt children. Laſtly, in the other of the 15 of March there is more then yieldings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions; a gracious prevention of our deſires: for he is pleaſed to excite and call upon that Great Councell, even the ſecond time, to prepare with all ſpeed ſuch Acts, as ſhall be for the eſtabliſhment of their priviledges, the free and quiet enjoying their eſtates and fortunes, the liberties of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the ſecuritie of the true Religion now profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church of England. What now ſhall we ſay to theſe things? Is not that of Solomon made good unto us (Prov. 16.10.) <hi>A Divine ſentence is in the lips of the King?</hi> Have we not good cauſe to take up Ezra's benediction (Ezr. 7.27.) <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord which hath put ſuch things as theſe into the Kings heart?</hi> Such things as theſe we were not ſo ambitious as to hope for: I truſt we ſhall not be ſo unworthy as to forget. For my ſelf, I could wiſh that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114893:16"/>to the dutie of this day, I could ſet them forth as they deſerve. But they need no varniſh of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: neither was it my intendment to uſe them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then for the proof of the propoſition in hand; to ſhew you how this higheſt excellency of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in the care of their peoples happineſſe, is radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in our Gracious Sovereign. Yet you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo that I told you, The point needs not ſo much <hi>proofs,</hi> as <hi>retributions.</hi> It cals aloud upon us for all dutifull returns, of honour, love, obedience, loyalty, and thankfull acknowledgements, into that Royall boſome, the firſt mover and originall under God of our happineſſe. In the ſphere of Nature there is none of us ignorant, how willing the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are to make return to the head, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and influence they receive from thence: they will undergo hardſhip, expoſe themſelves to danger, recede from things convenient, nay neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; they will not grudge at any plentie or honour which is beſtowed upon the head; knowing by inſtinct that from the head the benefit of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to them. It is likewiſe obvious in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of families, which are as States epitomized; that both honour and dutie belong to the <hi>Paterfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliâs,</hi> not onely for the right he hath in the houſe, but for the proviſion and ſupport and comfort which all receive from him.

Look as on the one ſide, the being of a State or Nation, as a collective bodie, is not ſo ordered to immortalitie, nor by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to happineſſe, as the being of a man: ſo on the other, the concurrence of temporall good things is in no wiſe ſo eſſentiall or requiſite to the happineſſe of a man, as to the being and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo to the happineſſe of a State or people. Experience tells us that a man may be happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>children;</hi> a State cannot be ſo without <hi>people:</hi> a private man may keep his hold of happineſſe, though <hi>poore</hi> and <hi>afflicted</hi> in the world; a State is onely then happy, when 'tis <hi>flouriſhing</hi> and <hi>proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> abounding with peace, plentie, people, and other civill acceſſions. Men are the walls for ſtrength, women the nurſeries for encreaſe, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the pledges of perpetuity, money as the vitall breath, peace as the naturall heat, plentie as the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall moiſture, religious and juſt government as the form or ſoul of a bodie politick. Upon this ground the Pſalmiſt well knowing how conducing theſe outward things are to popular happineſſe, he caſts them all into the definition; his preſent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument being the happineſſe of a people. In the ſecond place, admit he had ſpake here of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of a man, or a Chriſtian: yet he mentions not theſe temporalls, either as the <hi>all,</hi> or the <hi>onely,</hi> or the <hi>chief</hi> of happineſſe; but as the <hi>concomitants</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:114893:19"/>and <hi>acceſsories.</hi> They have not an <hi>eſsentiall</hi> influx or ingredience into it: but a <hi>ſecondarie</hi> and <hi>accidentall</hi> reſpect they have in theſe two conſiderations. Firſt they are <hi>ornamenta,</hi> as <hi>garniſhings,</hi> which give a gloſſe and luſtre to virtue, and make it more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did. The Moraliſts ſay well, that they are as ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to a picture, or garments to a comely perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Now as in theſe, the ſhadowing makes not the colour of a picture truly better, but onely ſeem better, and appear more freſh and orient; and as garments do indeed adorn the body now in the ſtate of corruption, whereas, if man had ſtood in his integritie, they had been uſeleſſe for ornament, as well as for neceſſity: So likewiſe theſe outward things, although in themſelves they have nothing of true happineſſe, yet becauſe they render it more beauteous and gracefull, as the ſtate of vertue now ſtands in reſpect of our converſe with men, we may well reckon them without prejudice to vertue <hi>inter ornamenta.</hi> Then ſecondly, they are <hi>adminicula</hi> alſo, <hi>helps</hi> and <hi>adjuments,</hi> as <hi>hand-maids</hi> to pietie, without which vertue is impotent. Were a man all ſoul, vertue alone were ſufficient; it is enough by it ſelf for the happineſſe of the mind: but being partly bodie, and enjoying corporall ſocietie with others, he ſtands in need of things corporall, to keep vertue in exerciſe. Want clippes the wings of vertue, that a man cannot feed the hungry, or cloth the naked, or enlarge himſelf to the good of others: on the other ſide, this

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers term it, ſets vertue at libertie, and gives it ſcope to be operative. As fire, the more aire &amp; few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114893:19"/>you give it, the more it diffuſeth it ſelf: ſo the more health, peace, plentie, friends, or authoritie we have; the more power, freedome and advantage we have to do vertuouſly. Put now all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; the reaſon is evident, vvhy the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid here placeth this happineſſe in the things vvhich are vvorſe; becauſe they are ſerviceable to the things vvhich are better. Hovvſoever he reſerves the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the better till aftervvard; Yet he vvould give us to underſtand, that even theſe inferiour things are the good blenſſigs of God, and ſuch bleſſings, as being put together, make up one part of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a people. It is true of popular happineſſe, as well as perſonall, It is not one ſingle good, but the aggregation or affluence of many. In the twenty eighth of Deuteronomie, where Moſes deſcribes the bleſſedneſſe promiſed to the Iſraelites, he reckons up all ſorts of outward bleſſings: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to thoſe is the conflux of theſe in this Pſalme: The bleſſing of the <hi>houſe,</hi> and of the <hi>citie; That there be no leading into captivitie, and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in the ſtreets:</hi> The bleſſings of the <hi>basket,</hi> and of the <hi>ſtore; That the garners may be filled with plentie:</hi> The bleſſings of the <hi>fruit of the bodie; That the children may be as young plants:</hi> The bleſſings of the <hi>field, That the ſheep may bring forth thouſands, and the oxen be ſtrong to labour:</hi> The bleſſings of <hi>going out</hi> and <hi>coming in; That they may be delivered from the hand of ſtrange children, and ſaved out of great waters.</hi> Here is briefly the compound of the many ſimples which make up this caſe or condition of a peoples happineſſe. And ſurely if by theſe particulars it be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114893:20"/>defined, we may boldly ſay, The condition is our own, and men may pronounce of us, as truly as of any Nation, that we have been for a long time a <hi>happy people.</hi> Our deliverances from ſtrange chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have been great and miraculous, and our land it hath been a Goſhen, a <hi>lightſome land;</hi> whereas the <hi>darkneſſe of diſcomfort</hi> hath reſted upon other Nations. The bleſſings of the citie and field, of the basket and of the ſtore have grown upon us in ſuch abundance, that many men have ſurfetted of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Our land hath been as an Eden and garden of the Lord for <hi>fruitfulneſſe,</hi> as a Salem for <hi>peace;</hi> whereas other kingdomes do yet grone under the preſſures of <hi>ſword</hi> and <hi>famine.</hi> Beſides theſe, if there be any bleſſing which the Scripture mentions in other places, <hi>Peace in the walls, Plentie in the palaces, Traffick in the ports,</hi> or <hi>Salvation in the gates;</hi> if any part of happineſſe which it ſpeaks of in this Pſalme, for plantings, or buildings, or reapings, or ſtorings, or peoplings; we have had them all in as much fulneſſe as any part of the world, and in more then moſt: onely there is one particular may be queſtioned, or rather cannot be denied That amidſt the very throng of all theſe bleſſings there are ſome <hi>murmurings and complainings in our ſtreets.</hi> But it need not ſeem ſtrange to us, becauſe it is not new in the world. In the ſtories of all ages we meet with it, That men uſed to complain of their times to be evil, when indeed themſelves made them ſo. I may be bold to ſay, There was cauſe in reſpect of ſinne then, as well as now, eſpecially with godly men, who are ſo good themſelves, that it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114893:20"/>if they thought times <hi>a little evil</hi> to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely bad:</hi> as alwayes ſinne ſwells to the eye of grace. But if we ſpeak of outward preſſures and calamities, I am certain there is not cauſe now as then: for the riches of the Kingdome were never ſo great, the peace of the Kingdome never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, the ſtate of it for all things never ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Onely we muſt give leave to the world to be like it ſelf: As long as ambition or covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are in the world, men of ſuch ſpirits will cry out, The times are bad, even when they are beſt; becauſe they (in their own bad ſenſe) ſtill deſire to be better. As nothing is enough, ſo nothing is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to a reſtleſſe mind. An inſatiable appetite is alwayes impatient; and, becauſe impatient, queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Yet this is not the ſole reaſon: for beſides this humour of appetite, the very corruption of our nature leads us hereunto, To be weary of the preſent. It is the joynt obſervation both of Divines and Moraliſts (as of Salvian, Quintilian, Tacitus, and others, who agree as near almoſt in words as in opinion) <hi>Quòd uſitatum eſt mentis humanae vitium, illa magìs ſemper velle qua deſunt; &amp;, vetera quidem in laude, praeſentiain fastidio ponere.</hi> Our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will tell us as much, if we will take pains to obſerve it, How, through the pravity of our own diſpoſitions, whatſoever is preſent proves burdenſome, whether it be good or bad. Salvian, in his third <hi>De Gubernatione,</hi> ſets forth this humour to the life: That men of all times were diſpleaſed with all times: <hi>Si aeſtus est,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>de ariditate cauſamur; ſi fluvia, de inundatione conquerimur: ſi
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114893:21"/>infoecundior annus eſt, accuſamus ſterilitatem; ſi foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundior, vilitatem.</hi> So winter and ſummer are both alike diſtaſtfull to impatient men: In ſcarcity things are too dear, in plentie too cheap: povertie pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and abundance nauſeates. If there be a little too much drought, they cry out of a famine; if a ſhowre or two extraordinary, they are affraid of a deluge. You ſhall heare in good times, <hi>Quid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis cum Davide?</hi> and in bad, <hi>Antigonum effodio:</hi> as we reade of the Iſraelites, That even when God himſelf was pleaſed to order their civill affairs, they were not contented; but ſtill repined, as well when they had manna, as when they wanted it. The reaſon is (as the Greek Hiſtorian notes)

It beſeems not us of all others to be ſo injurious to <hi>God,</hi> who hath ſingled us out to be a happy people: It beſeems us not to be ſo unthankfull to our <hi>Sovereigne,</hi> under whom we enjoy theſe bleſſings. Howſoever it ought to be in the firſt place acknowledged, that the originall of all our happineſſe is from heaven: yet it muſt be confeſt withall, that the chryſtall pipe through which bleſſings are conveyed unto us, is his government: Our peace is from his wiſdome; our plentie from our peace; our proſperitie from our plenty; our ſafetie, our very life, our whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver good of this nature, it is by Gods providence wrapt up in his welfare, whoſe precious life (as the Oratour ſpeaks) is <hi>Vita quaedam publica,</hi> the very <hi>breath of our noſtrils</hi> perfumed with multitude of comforts.

                  <p>I now proceed to the ſecond, the path of <hi>Pietie,</hi> anſwerable to the <hi>Religious</hi> reſpect; <hi>Yea, happy.</hi> It's the beſt wine to the laſt, though all men be not of this opinion. You ſhall hardly bring a worldly man to think ſo. The world is willing enough to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſter the order of the words, and to give the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie to Civill happineſſe, as if it were firſt in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie, becauſe 'tis firſt named: they like it better to hear of the <hi>Cui ſic,</hi> then the <hi>Cui Dominus.</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this follie, the Pſalmiſt interpoſeth a caution in this corrective particle, <hi>Yea, Happy.</hi> It hath the force of a revocation, whereby he ſeems to retract what went before, not ſimply and abſolutely, but in a certain degree, leſt worldly men ſhould wreſt it to a miſinterpretation. It is not an <hi>abſolute</hi> revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but a <hi>comparative;</hi> it doth not ſimply deny that there is ſome part of popular happineſſe in theſe outward things, but it preferres the ſpiritualls before them: <hi>Yea,</hi> that is, <hi>Yea more,</hi> or, <hi>Yea rather:</hi> like that of Chriſt in the Goſpel, When one in the companie bleſſed the wombe that bare him,
<note place="margin">Lek. 11.28.</note> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently replies, <hi>Yea, rather bleſſed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.</hi> In like manner the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet David, having firſt premiſed the inferiour part
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114893:22"/>and outſide of an happy condition; fearing leſt any ſhould of purpoſe miſtake his meaning, and hearing the firſt propoſition, ſhould either there ſet up their reſt, and not at all take in the ſecond; or if take it in, yet do it prepoſterouſly, and give it the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before the ſecond, according to the worlds order, <hi>virtus poſt nummos:</hi> In this reſpect he puts in the clauſe of revocation; whereby he ſhews, that theſe outward things, though <hi>named</hi> firſt, yet they are not to be <hi>reputed</hi> firſt. The particle <hi>Yea</hi> removes them to the ſecond place: it tacitly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the order; and the path of piety, which was <hi>locally</hi> after, it placeth <hi>virtually</hi> before. 'Tis as if he had ſaid, Did I call them <hi>happy,</hi> who are in ſuch a caſe? Nay, <hi>miſerable</hi> are they, if they be onely in ſuch a caſe: The <hi>temporall</hi> part cannot make them ſo without the <hi>ſpirituall.</hi> Admit the windows of the viſible heaven were opened, and all outward bleſſings powred down upon us; admit we did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly enjoy whatſoever the vaſtneſſe of the earth contains in it: tell me, What will it profit to gain all, and to loſe God? If the earth be beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and not heaven; or the materiall heaven be opened, and not the beatificall; or the whole world made ours, and God not ours: we do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at happineſſe. All that is in the firſt propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nothing, unleſſe this be added, <hi>Yea, happy are the people which have the</hi> LORD <hi>for their God.</hi> You ſee in this part there is <hi>aliquid quod eminet,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is tranſcendent: Therefore I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into two particulars; ſee both what it is that tranſcends, and what is the manner of propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:114893:22"/>
                  <p>The manner of propounding it, is, as I ſaid, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, or by way of revocation: the ſumme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is thus much, That temporalls without ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, in what aboundance ſoever we poſſeſſe them, cannot make us truly happy. They cannot make <hi>happy,</hi> becauſe they cannot make <hi>good.</hi> They may denominate a man to be <hi>rich,</hi> or <hi>great,</hi> or <hi>honourable;</hi> but not to be <hi>virtuous.</hi> Nay, Seneca carrieth it a little further, <hi>Non modò non faciunt bonum, fed nec divitem;</hi> They are ſo farre from making a man <hi>good,</hi> that they make him not <hi>truly rich;</hi> becauſe they encreaſe deſire, and riches conſiſt in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Not he that hath little, but he that deſires more is poor: nor he that hath much, but he that wants nothing is rich. Yea, and we may go further then Seneca; They are ſo farre from making <hi>good,</hi> that they often make <hi>evill,</hi> if they be not ſanctified: they poſſeſſe the heart with vile affections, fill it full of carnall and ſinfull deſires. Wheras there are foure good mothers which bring forth ill daughters, proſperitie is one. Truth begets hatred, ſecuritie danger, familiaritie contempt, proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pride and forgetfulneſſe of God. In this I might well make a ſtop; but there is one degree more: They are ſo farre from <hi>making</hi> good, that they do not <hi>bring</hi> good, but many evils and inconveniences. They bring not the good of <hi>contentment,</hi> but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtractions: they are <hi>aureae compedes,</hi> as S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard ſpeaks, fetters or manicles which entangle the ſoul, that it cannot attend upon better things: Nor the good of <hi>freedome:</hi> they do enthrall the ſoul to that which is worſe then it ſelf; and it cannot
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114893:23"/>be apprehended how a thing worſe then our ſelves can make us happy. Laſtly, not the good of <hi>ſafetie:</hi> for they oftentimes expoſe us to dangers, <hi>Multos ſua felicitas ſtravit,</hi> as Gregorie ſpeaks. Many men their lives had been longer, if their riches had been leſſe: their happineſſe made them miſerable; <hi>&amp; conſolationes factae ſunt deſolationes,</hi> as S. Bernard again. Upon theſe grounds the Pſalmiſt had very good reaſon to ſequeſter them from true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and, by this corrective particle, to reduce them to the ſecond place, though he ſet them in the firſt. He knew very well that they are burdens, ſhares, impediments to piety, as often as furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. He knew them to be vain and tranſitory things,
<note place="margin">Prov. 23.5.</note> that we cannot hold. <hi>They make themſelves wings,</hi> as Solomon ſpeaks. They are onely the moveables of happineſſe, <hi>Bractealis felicitas,</hi> as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca;
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as Nazianzen. What's that? S. Auſtin ſeems to tranſlate it, <hi>felicitas fallax,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous and perſonate felicitie: Nay, not onely <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax,</hi> but <hi>falſa,</hi> fictitious, ſpurious, deceitfull, which leaves the ſoul <hi>empty</hi> when it moſt <hi>fills</hi> it: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt true which the ſame Father adds, <hi>felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas fallax, major infelicitas; &amp; falſa felicitas, vera miſeria.</hi> Therefore, that I may ſhut up this point, let this be the uſe of it. We muſt learn from hence to regulate our judgements according to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Spirit revealed in the word: And that we may do, if we keep to Gods method, and ſet every thing in the due place, where God hath ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Now the Scripture conſtantly doth give the inferiour place to theſe temporall things. If to come
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114893:23"/>after, be inferiour; it ſets them there: <hi>Seek firſt the kingdome of God,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 6.33. If to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, be inferiour, it placeth them there: <hi>Set your affection on things above,</hi> &amp;c. Coloſſ. 3.2. Even gold and ſilver, the beſt of theſe things, they are ſeated under the feet of men, and the whole world under the feet of a Chriſtian, Rev. 12.1. to teach us to deſpiſe it. Laſtly, if to be on the left hand, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour; the Scripture reckons them there too: they are called <hi>the bleſsings of the left hand,</hi> to teach us to give them the ſame place in our affections. In one ſenſe, we may put them on the right, by uſing them to God's glorie: but in love and eſteem they muſt be on the left. S. Hierome illuſtrates it by this ſimilitude: As flax when it is on the diſtaffe, it is on the left hand; but when it is ſpunne into yarn, and put on the ſpindle, it is on the right: ſo temporall things in themſelves, when firſt we receive them, they are as flax on the diſtaffe, all this while on the left hand; but ſpinne them forth, and uſe them to God's glorie, they are as yarn on the ſpindle, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the right. Thus we muſt learn to order them: to the right hand onely for <hi>uſe,</hi> to the left for <hi>valuation.</hi> Otherwiſe, if we pervert God's order, and put them on the <hi>right;</hi> it is to be feared they will ſet us on the <hi>left</hi> at the day of judgement: if we elevate them <hi>above,</hi> they will keep us <hi>below;</hi> and make us come <hi>after,</hi> if we ſet them <hi>before.</hi> The higheſt place they can have, is to be ſeconds to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: here holy David placeth them though he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pietie laſt, yet he giveth it the precedence in this word of revocation, <hi>Yea, happie;</hi> that is, <hi>Yea
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114893:24"/>firſt, yea more, yea more truly happie.</hi> That ſhall ſerve for the firſt particular, the manner of propounding this truth unto us.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the thing it ſelf which tranſcends, in theſe words, <hi>whoſe God is the</hi> LORD, or, <hi>who have the</hi> LORD <hi>for their God.</hi> In the generall it is an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> as well as <hi>tranſcendent.</hi> An ordinary, becauſe all partake of this priviledge. Whereupon S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin asks the queſtion, <hi>Cujus non eſt Deus?</hi> But S. Hierome reſolves it; <hi>Naturâ Deus omnium, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate paucorum:</hi> In a communitie the God of all, even to the ſparrow on the houſe top, and graſſe of the field; but the God of the righteous after a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner. To come to the meaning; we muſt let go the generall, this <hi>ordo communis providentiae,</hi> as he is <hi>Dominus omnium,</hi> the Lord of all creatures: this brings not happineſſe along with it: God's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and generall providence intitles not to that ſupreme bleſſedneſſe, which is in himſelf. The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall references are onely intended: and thoſe we may reduce to theſe two heads. The firſt is <hi>ordo ſpecialis influxûs,</hi> on God's part, the reſpect of his being gracious to us. Then the Lord is <hi>our God,</hi> when he ſhews himſelf benigne and propitious, when he manifeſts his mercie and goodneſſe in the wayes of grace and means of ſalvation. It is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Pſalme 65.4. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chooſeſt:</hi> and Pſalme 33.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the nation, whoſe God is the</hi> LORD, <hi>and the people whom he hath choſen for his own inheritance.</hi> Being thus taken, it affords us this meditation, That there is no true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, but in the favour of God, and light of his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114893:24"/>countenance; that is, in God himſelf: both becauſe happineſſe is onely <hi>from him,</hi> he is the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of it: <hi>Non facit beatum hominem, niſi qui fecit hominem;— Qui dedit ut homines ſimus, ſolus dat ut beati ſimus;</hi> He onely makes <hi>Saints</hi> who makes <hi>men:</hi> 'tis S. Auſtin's elegant expreſſion. Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as it is onely <hi>from God,</hi> ſo it is onely <hi>in God.</hi> As the ſoul, ſaith Auſtin, is <hi>vita carnis;</hi> ſo God is the <hi>beata vita hominis,</hi> ſo fully, that a man cannot be happy either way, <hi>nec abſque Deo, nec extra De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> not <hi>without God,</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>Doner;</hi> not <hi>out of God,</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>thing it ſelf,</hi> and all which belongs to it. As S. Ambroſe of the foure beatitudes in S. Luke compared with the eight in S. Matthew; <hi>In iſtis octo illae quatuor ſunt, &amp; in iſtis quatuor illae octo:</hi> and as King Porus, when Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander askt him how he would be uſed, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one word,

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>like a King.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander again replying, Do you deſire nothing elſe? No, ſaith he: all things are in

                     </gap>, So in this which we are now about it holds much more: both the <hi>foure,</hi> and the <hi>eight,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, they are in God, ſo that he who hath God, muſt needs have all things, becauſe God is all things. There is no notion under which we can couch beatitude, but we may find it in God by way of eminencie: if as a ſtate of joy, or glory, or wealth, or tranquillitie, or ſecuritie, God is all theſe: if as a ſtate of perfection, ſalvation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution; God is all theſe: not onely the <hi>giver of the reward,</hi> but the <hi>rewardit ſelf;</hi> both our <hi>bonum,</hi> and our <hi>ſummum.</hi> A Chriſtian is never truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114893:25"/>till he can find himſelf and all things in God. The fruition of God, it is

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>(as Peluſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ſpeaks) the very top of the ſpire or pinacle of beatitude both here and in heaven. <hi>In hoc uno ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitas beatitudinis eliquatur,</hi> to uſe Tertullians words. Were a man in paradiſe, were he in heaven it ſelf, and had not God; he could not be happy. Were he on Job's dunghill, in Daniels den, in the belly of hell with Jonah, nay in the infernall hell with Dives, and yet had God; he could not be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for heaven is whereſoever God is, becauſe his influxive preſence maketh heaven. That's the <hi>Ordo influxûs</hi> I mentioned, for which he is ſaid to be <hi>our God.</hi> Beſides this, there is <hi>ordo Divini cultûs,</hi> on our part, The reſpect of our being ſerviceable to him: when we love him, and fear him, and honour him, and adhere unto him as we ought. To all theſe there is bleſſedneſſe pronounced in ſeverall Pſalmes: to thoſe that <hi>fear him,</hi> Pſal. 128.1. to thoſe that <hi>keep his teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119.2. to thoſe that <hi>truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 84.12. If we take it thus, the point is this in ſumme, There is no true happineſſe, but in the worſhip and ſervice of God: <hi>Felices ſunt qui Deo vivunt,</hi> that's S. Bernards: <hi>Servire Deo eſt regnare,</hi> that's S. Ambroſe his expreſſion: As much as this, The godly man is onely the true happy man. Yet we muſt underſtand it aright: It is not to ſerve him onely in outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which either makes us <hi>his,</hi> or him <hi>ours.</hi> There are many who pretend to ſerve him, who cannot challenge this intereſt: for they ſerve him but with their <hi>lips;</hi> in <hi>act,</hi> themſelves and their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114893:25"/>own pleaſures: in this both hypocrites and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that under the ſhew of one God ſet up many to themſelves. The Epicure he makes his belly his God, the laſcivious man his luſt, the voluptuous man his pleaſure, the factious man his humour, the covetous man his mammon. I name this laſt. It is the obſervation of S. Auſtin, in his 7 book <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> and of Lactantius in his ſecond <hi>De Origine Erroris,</hi> That avarice gives laws to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whil'ſt generally <hi>ſub obtentu Numinis cupiditas colitur.</hi> Yea, and S. Paul expreſſeth it more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, That <hi>covetouſneſse is idolatry,</hi> Col. 3.5. And <hi>the covetous man an idolater,</hi> Epheſ. 5.5. For he doth the ſame to his <hi>gold,</hi> that the heathen did to their <hi>idoles:</hi> he makes his gold his God; his God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his joy, and his care, and his confidence: Thoſe pictures he worſhips, though otherwiſe he abhorres idoles; to theſe he offers his ſervice, he gives them his heart, he extols them, aſcribes unto them the glory of his happineſſe: Theſe are thy gods, O Iſrael, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: this money got thee ſuch a preferment, procured ſuch a deliverance, prevailed in ſuch a ſuite. It's the ſecret idolatrie which runnes through the world. But ſuch men as theſe, they are as farre from God as from his ſervice, and as farre from happineſſe as from God. Whoſoever will make ſure of the Lord to be his God, he muſt put the idoles out of his heart, he muſt go out of himſelf, he muſt not willingly harbour any ſinne. Sinne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates from God, excludes from happineſſe, cuts off both priviledges, of God's being ours, and our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114893:26"/>being God's. Yet there is one thing more; with which I will conclude: Since it is ſo, that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſeated in theſe mutuall intercurrences, of calling the Lord <hi>our God,</hi> and our ſelves <hi>his people;</hi> and ſeeing religion is the <hi>Vinculum unionis,</hi> which makes theſe mutuall intereſts intercurrent, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples them together; it follows as the upſhot of all, That the chief and choiceſt part of Nationall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe conſiſts in the puritie of God's worſhip, in the enjoying of God's ordinances, in the free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Goſpel; that is, in the truth and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of religion. In this alone there are all ſweets, all beauties, all bliſſes, all glories. It is as the ark of God to Iſrael, and as the golden candleſtick to the Churches, the elevating principle which advanceth a Chriſtian Nation above the heathen, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches above other Chriſtian Nations, and this Iland in which we live (I may ſay without arrogancie) above all. There is no Nation in the world, which hath had the condition of religion ſo pure and proſperous, as we, for almoſt theſe hundred yeares. It's true, if God calls us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we cannot ſay that we have anſwered our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities: we find not wherein to boaſt of our righteouſneſſe; for vve are a ſinfull people, vvhoſe lives (for the moſt part of us) are as much vvorſe, as our means and profeſſions better then in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is true alſo, that of later yeares the love of religion in moſt hath grovvn cold, and the puritie by ſome hath been ſtained and corrupted: and I vvill not novv diſcuſſe vvhere the fault hath been; the rather, becauſe it is every mans endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114893:26"/>it from himſelf. Onely I will adde thus much, That whereſoever the fault is, there is no man hath ſhewed himſelf more forward to reform it then the King himſelf. But Princes cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes attain their ends according to their liking, becauſe they ſee with other eyes, and execute with other hands then their own. And if we ſhould caſt the faults of men upon authoritie, we ſhould do wrong (I fear) to thoſe who do not deſerve it: for even this very yeare, notwithſtanding the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of corruptions hath been with ſo much zeal and diligence endeavoured, yet the end is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: Nay, in ſome reſpects, it is ſo farre ſet back that, to my underſtanding, the ſtate of religion hath never been worſe ſince the firſt reformation, then this preſent yeare: in reſpect, firſt, of the greatneſſe of our diſtractions, which have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided us all one from another: then, of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſects and ſectaries which cry indeed, as the Jews before them, <hi>Templum Domini;</hi> but with a worſe addition, <hi>ut Templum Domini diruatur.</hi> Laſtly, in reſpect of the many diſhonours done to the ſervice of God, with ſo much ſcorn and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to religion, that in forein parts they queſtion, whether all this time we had any. No doubt all this is come upon us for our ſinnes: let us remove them, and then God will bleſſe our ſtudie of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But yet in the mean time let us remember that meſſage, which the good Biſhop ſent to Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, <hi>Domine, ſol ad occaſum deſcendit.</hi> Our ſun-ſhine is but yet declining; it may come to ſet, if we now begin to diſguſt this greateſt bleſſing of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114893:27"/>religion, which God hath beſtowed upon us. Let us learn to regard it more, to love it better, to bleſſe God for <hi>it,</hi> and for <hi>his government</hi> who upholds it: a Prince ſo devout and religious in his own perſon, that if all were like him, we ſhould have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Saints. In this reſpect, we may uſe Velleius his words of his Majeſtie, <hi>Cùm ſit imperio Maximus, exemplo Major eſt:</hi> The luſtre of his <hi>pietie</hi> ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the luſtre of his <hi>empire.</hi> If therefore that of Syneſius be true, That men generally affect to write after the copies which are ſet by their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; it behoves us all, both to take out the <hi>leſſon,</hi> and to bleſſe God for the <hi>copie.</hi> And moreover, as this day puts us in mind, let us all ſend up our moſt affectionate prayers, that his Throne may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Righteouſneſſe, his Crown exalted with Honour, his Scepter be for <hi>power</hi> like Moſes rod, for <hi>flouriſhing</hi> like Aaron's; that his happy reigne may in <hi>himſelf</hi> outlive us all, and in <hi>his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> be perpetuated to all generations; that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages may confeſſe, <hi>Surely God hath been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable unto this land, and hath not dealt ſo with any Nation. O how happy are the people that are in ſuch a caſe! Yea, how happy are the people which have the Lord for their God!</hi>

                  <p>The Prophet here in this place takes on him the Office, and function of a <hi>Schoole-Maſter:</hi> having learned the Art of <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> the heavenly art of <hi>ſpeech</hi> himſelfe, he labours to train up others to the knowledge of the ſame Art: and I ſhal
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114893:29"/>not think much to be his <hi>ſcholler</hi> at this time, and to preſſe theſe words a little further then the Prophet intended them. He gives them only as a rule of <hi>direction</hi> to the people, how to <hi>pray</hi> to God, but they may ſerve as a rule of <hi>direction</hi> to Miniſters how to ſpeak to the <hi>people:</hi> and indeed, if this go before the other will the better a great deale follow. That you may with ſpeed <hi>turne</hi> to God, it becomes us to <hi>turne</hi> to <hi>you;</hi> we muſt <hi>call</hi> upon <hi>you,</hi> that you would pleaſe to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; wee muſt firſt open our mouthes to <hi>you,</hi> that you would <hi>open</hi> yours before the <hi>Throne of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed I muſt needs confeſſe, that I have been too long ſilent from this Theame of <hi>repentance,</hi> conſidering what the times are. Our <hi>dangers</hi> are <hi>great,</hi> &amp; our <hi>careleſnes</hi> is as great no man goes about to labour to meet <hi>God.</hi> I can hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and when I look upon this Scripture, methinkes I may take <hi>Elihu's</hi> ſpeech into my mouth. <hi>Behold I am full of matter, and the Spirit within me conſtraineth me: My belly is as new wine, which hath no vent, it is ready to burſt like new bottles. I will now ſpeake and keepe ſilence no longer.</hi> Me thinkes I heare the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> behind me, calling upon me as <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Aaron, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p, haſt thee, get thee to the congregation, the plague is begun, and they are all aſleepe,</hi> and there is no man that <hi>ſpreads</hi> his <hi>Armes,</hi> and no man that <hi>lifts</hi> up his <hi>voyce</hi> to God. Speake to them, and ſpeake to the purpoſe, I, ſpeake home, call upon them, to <hi>Take to themſelves words, and to returne to the Lord, and ſay</hi> thus, and thus to him.</p>
                  <p>And that I may doe it now to purpoſe, I will take the words in pieces; ſo they preſent to us theſe two particulars.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>excitement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there is a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>direction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The forme of <hi>excitement,</hi> that is in theſe words, <hi>Take to you words, and turne to the Lord, and ſay to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:114893:29"/>
                  <p>The form of <hi>direction,</hi> that is in the other words, <hi>Take away all iniquitie, and receive us gratiouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the former of theſe parts, there are two things obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable; a <hi>double excitement;</hi> an excitement to duty of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Turne to the Lord;</hi> an excitement to the duty of elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Take to you words, and ſay to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the latter, there are theſe two parts alſo.</p>
                  <p>One direction is for <hi>grace,</hi> that is to be given from <hi>above; Take away all our iniquities, and receive us gatiouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other direction is for returne of <hi>thankes,</hi> for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God from below, <hi>So will we give the calves of our lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt; and that is, the rule or forme of <hi>excitement,</hi> and that is double, for two duties. And the firſt excitement is to a dutie of action, <hi>Turne to the Lord:</hi> it is not the firſt thing ſpecified in the order of the words; but it is the firſt that I will take in, in the order of handling them: ſo, it will goe well if wee read it thus, <hi>Turne to the Lord, and take with you words and ſay.</hi> Thus,</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing is for <hi>turning</hi> to the <hi>Lord;</hi> the dutie to which they were exhorted in the former verſe, yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth it here again: He ſaw their <hi>backwardnes</hi> was great, and therefore he pricks them <hi>twiſe</hi> forward. He knew it was a dutie of importance, that was to be done oft, and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Et nunquam nimis dicitur, quod nunquam nimis diſcitur.</hi> It can never be ſpoken too oft, that can never be learned too oft: it can never be preſſed too much, that can never be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and underſtood too much: as they were to do it <hi>dayly,</hi> ſo he <hi>cals</hi> upon them <hi>dayly</hi> in the former verſe, and in this verſe. This is ſo evident, that I need not ſtand further on it, I ſhall not need therefore to ſpeake of it; nor yet of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of theſe words, that is ſeene by the coherence of the Text.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet in the ſpirit of propheſie foreſaw the great miſerie that was readie to fall upon them, he foreſaw the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114893:30"/>great captivitie that God would bring on them, therefore nowſo long before, he cals upon them to prevent thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; yet there was opportunitie to avert the captivitie: he ſpeakes to them therefore, that they would bethinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that God might turne his purpoſe of the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that they would <hi>turne</hi> now the courſe of their ſins, that they would <hi>Turne from their evill wayes</hi> to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The only things I will obſerve here in the firſt Phraſe, are theſe two.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>meaning</hi> of the <hi>Phraſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> that may be drawne from it.</p>
                  <p>For the meaning of the phraſe: it's a phraſe that we oft meet with, therefore it will be worth our looking to ſee what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is here, to which the Prophet exhorts them: for to one of theſe two, it muſt needs be referred; either to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or to repentance, and yet it is doubtfull to which of theſe.</p>
                  <p>For if wee ſay to <hi>prayer;</hi> it is to <hi>repentance</hi> as well as that: for <hi>repentance</hi> is a <hi>turning</hi> to God as well as <hi>prayer.</hi> And if we ſay he exhorts them to the dutie of <hi>repentance,</hi> it ſeems: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for <hi>converſion</hi> is but halfe the worke of <hi>repentance. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> conſiſts of two acts, there are two parts of it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of it is <hi>contrition,</hi> or <hi>humiliation,</hi> that is the <hi>penal,</hi> or <hi>paſſive</hi> part of repentance.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part only is <hi>converſion</hi> or <hi>reforming</hi> of our wayes, and that is the <hi>active</hi> part: it ſeemes therefore it is not meant of <hi>repentance,</hi> becauſe that is but halfe.</p>
                  <p>Again if we ſay, he exhorts to <hi>converſion,</hi> that implies but <hi>halfe repentance:</hi> for <hi>converſion</hi> it implies a <hi>turning</hi> from <hi>ſinne,</hi> before wee can <hi>turne</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> Therefore the beſt courſe will be to take in all theſe; <hi>humiliation</hi> as the firſt thing in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and averſion from ſinne, as that that alway accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies true <hi>humiliation;</hi> and <hi>turning</hi> to God by <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>ſupplication,</hi> as that part of repentance, which is the <hi>laſt</hi> in <hi>act,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114893:30"/>but the firſt in intent: We may well take them in all, for the Scripture allowes us this libertie: the Scripture ſets forth to us the whole worke of repentance in all the parts of it, by this one phraſe of <hi>turning to the Lord,</hi> and there is no phraſe uſed in Scripture to ſet out the worke of repentance ofter then this, <hi>Turne to the Lord.</hi> Therefore wee may take in both the duties, prayer, and repentance, and humiliation. So it is thus much in effect, <hi>Turne to the Lord, humble your ſelves before God; lament</hi> your <hi>ſinnes, renounce</hi> all thoſe <hi>tranſgreſſions</hi> you have provoked him by; <hi>caſt</hi> them from <hi>you,</hi> leaſt they <hi>caſt</hi> you from him, <hi>cut them off,</hi> leaſt they <hi>cut you off:</hi> leaving your tranſgreſſions, you may come with <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>boldnes,</hi> to the <hi>Throne of grace,</hi> you may call on him, and pray to him. Both then are to be taken in; the dutie of prayer, and the dutie of repentance. And there is good reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p>They both agree to the ſcope of the place: for the words are either the <hi>excitement</hi> of a <hi>prophane</hi> heart, to the worke of <hi>devotion,</hi> or of a hard, <hi>impenitent</hi> heart to the work of contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>remorſe:</hi> and the next words ſhew ſo much. <hi>Aſhur,</hi> and your <hi>owne arme</hi> cannot ſave you, he is the Father of the Fatherleſſe; as if he he had ſaid, <hi>Turne to the Lord,</hi> or pray that he would deliver you: for, <hi>Aſhur,</hi> and your owne arme cannot ſave you: and turne to the Lord by <hi>repentance,</hi> that he would pardon you, <hi>For in him the Fatherleſſe ſinde mercie;</hi> they agree with the ſcope of place.</p>
                  <p>And they agree with the <hi>coherence, Take to you words, words</hi> are as neceſſary to be taken to the duty of repentance, as to the dutie of <hi>prayer;</hi> neceſſary to both.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>penitent</hi> man, when he comes before God, he takes <hi>words,</hi> they are <hi>bitter, mournfull words,</hi> whereby he enlageth and openeth his heartto God: and the <hi>devout</hi> man he takes <hi>words,</hi> they are words of <hi>zeale</hi> and <hi>fervencie, moving,</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive words, that God would be reconciled: both the <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent unloads</hi> himſelfe this way, and the <hi>devout</hi> heart he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114893:31"/>
                     <hi>enlarg eth</hi> himſelfe, both take words. It agrees to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, all of them agree to the <hi>metaphor,</hi> it is called <hi>turning to God: repentance</hi> is a <hi>turning,</hi> as well as <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> as well as <hi>repentance;</hi> ſo that the difference be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the application of this word unto them both.</p>
                  <p>irſt, <hi>repentance</hi> is a <hi>diametricall turning,</hi> a turning from the greateſt evill, to the greateſt good, from <hi>ſinne</hi> to <hi>God. Prayer</hi> is not a <hi>diametricall</hi> turning, but a <hi>collaterall</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is not from the <hi>greateſt evill</hi> to the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> but from a <hi>leſſe</hi> good to a <hi>greater</hi> good; from the workes of our calling, from the exerciſe of leſſer things, to an <hi>holie dutie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, repentance is a finall turning, never to come back to <hi>ſinne more;</hi> it is alwayes a purpoſe to goe <hi>forwards</hi> to God, and never to looke back to the point it is turned from. Prayer is not a <hi>finall</hi> turning, it is a <hi>temporarie</hi> turning; wee leave <hi>ſecular</hi> workes to have recourſe to God; but when prayer is ended, God allows, and gives us leave to mannage the affaires of our <hi>calling,</hi> ſo it be in a decent faſhion; it is not a <hi>finall</hi> turning; yet both are <hi>turnings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prayer is a turning as <hi>Damſcaene</hi> defines it, <hi>Elevatio cordis ad deum,</hi> a lifting up of the heart to God: in that it is an <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> a turning of the heart, wherein the <hi>devout</hi> ſoule flies <hi>above</hi> the thoughts and meditations of all <hi>earthly</hi> things, and goes out of it ſelfe for the <hi>fruition</hi> and enjoyment of the <hi>comforts</hi> of <hi>Gods ſpirit,</hi> that it may lay open its <hi>wants</hi> before God; it is a turning of the <hi>heart</hi> and of the <hi>voyce,</hi> and of every <hi>outward</hi> part of a man: in prayer, there the eye is turned, by looking <hi>up,</hi> the hands are turned by <hi>ſpreading</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, the Knees are turned by <hi>bowing</hi> before his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole, and the <hi>heart</hi> is turned by going out of it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Prayer leaves the world, <hi>Tranſoendit mundum,</hi> as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeakes, it goes above the world, above the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114893:31"/>Cloudes, it reſts not till it come to God; <hi>prayer</hi> is a <hi>turning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more particularly repentance is a turning.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Totall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Finall</hi> turning or change that is wrought in the mind, in the <hi>actions</hi> of the bodie, in the whole man; <hi>Repentance</hi> workes a <hi>change</hi> in the <hi>whole</hi> man; not in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeakes; not a <hi>corporall, viſible</hi> change wrought in the ſubſtance of the <hi>ſoule</hi> or <hi>fleſh,</hi> or in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, or <hi>dimenſions</hi> of it. Though <hi>repentance</hi> bring a change in that ſometimes, when it brings the <hi>bodie</hi> to <hi>meagernes</hi> and <hi>py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> but the <hi>change</hi> is wrought in the <hi>qualities</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> and the <hi>actions</hi> of the <hi>bodie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a perfect change.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a <hi>generall, univerſall</hi> turning In reſpect of the <hi>ſubject;</hi> it workes a perfect change in every part, a <hi>dark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> before, is turned to <hi>light;</hi> a <hi>ſervile will</hi> is now turned to <hi>libertie; rebellious affections</hi> are turned now to <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> a <hi>hard heart</hi> is turned to ſoftneſſe and meekneſſe: and ſo in the bodie, the <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>wantoneſſe</hi> is turned to an <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie;</hi> the <hi>uncircumciſed eare</hi> is turned to an <hi>eare</hi> of <hi>obedience;</hi> the <hi>rough hands,</hi> as <hi>Eſaus,</hi> are turned to the hands of <hi>Jacob;</hi> in every thing there is a change. This is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>Wherin a <hi>true Chriſtian</hi> differs from a <hi>formal;</hi> a <hi>formal</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is <hi>changed,</hi> and turned, but not univerſally in every part. He turnes from <hi>ſome</hi> ſin that he begins to loath by infirmitie of nature; or becauſe his purſe will not hold out to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it; or the <hi>ſhame</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> cries him downe, or for ſome <hi>ſiniſter reſpects:</hi> but he keepes his <hi>darling</hi> boſome <hi>ſinne,</hi> O, his <hi>beloved</hi> ſinne he will not part with. He will heare in <hi>many things gladly,</hi> and reforme, as <hi>Herod;</hi> he will take a half turne with <hi>Agrippa;</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> preached, ſaith he, <hi>almoſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt;</hi> he was <hi>wambling;</hi> he could finde in his heart to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114893:32"/>turne, but he was loath to leave his ſinnes. But it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with a <hi>true penitent;</hi> as he turnes in earneſt, ſo he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make the change <hi>diſcernable</hi> in <hi>all</hi> parts; he caſts off <hi>all</hi> the raggs of <hi>old Adam,</hi> he caſts out <hi>all ſinne,</hi> he leaves not a <hi>horne</hi> or a <hi>hoofe</hi> behind. <hi>Repentance</hi> is ſuch a grace, that it ſcrapes off <hi>all Leviathans</hi> skales. It is a <hi>laver</hi> that waſheth away all the <hi>Lepers ſpots,</hi> it makes of an <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> an <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite;</hi> it works not only a <hi>palpable,</hi> but an <hi>univerſall</hi> change. That is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it is <hi>univerſall</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>ſubject;</hi> ſo it is <hi>total</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>act.</hi> Repentance is ſuch a <hi>turning</hi> as goes to the <hi>contrary point:</hi> it is ſuch a turning as keepes ſtill a direct <hi>oppoſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And herein a <hi>true convert</hi> differs from a <hi>formall Chriſtian:</hi> the <hi>formall</hi> Chriſtian he turnes <hi>ſide-wayes;</hi> when he begins to have <hi>ſome deteſtation</hi> of ſinne wrought in him, he ſeemes to <hi>turne</hi> a <hi>little.</hi> As a man that hath his <hi>back</hi> upon the <hi>North-point;</hi> if he turne his back to the <hi>South,</hi> he ſtands in direct <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> to that point he looked to before: but if he turne his <hi>face</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or <hi>Weſt,</hi> he may looke to the <hi>North</hi> or <hi>South</hi> at the ſame time; he <hi>turnes</hi> but <hi>halfe,</hi> but <hi>ſide wayes,</hi> if he turne from the North to the Eaſt: So a formall convert, he turnes, but he keepes a <hi>learing</hi> eye upon ſinne: he lookes to <hi>ſinne,</hi> and to <hi>God</hi> at the <hi>ſame</hi> time; when he is in <hi>ſecret</hi> he lookes to ſinne: but when he is in company he lookes to <hi>God:</hi> he lookes to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the <hi>ſame</hi> time, he will have his <hi>backe,</hi> not upon the <hi>North,</hi> but <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt,</hi> that he may looke <hi>both wayes.</hi> But a true Convert turnes <hi>point blank</hi> from the point he was in before to the contrarie; becauſe there is no communion between <hi>grace and ſin;</hi> there is no ſtanding betweene them both. <hi>Newtrall,</hi> hovering hearts, <hi>luke warme</hi> hearts, that partake of both tempers, ſuch hearts God abhors more then cold, prophane hearts: The godly man will not doe ſo; he knowes that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:114893:32"/>ſtand in oppoſition, and <hi>contrarietie,</hi> and repugnancie with <hi>ſin;</hi> he gets cleare to the other point. <hi>Sinne</hi> turns our <hi>backe</hi> upon <hi>God, repentance</hi> ſets our <hi>face</hi> to <hi>God: ſinne</hi> is a <hi>madneſſe</hi> or <hi>diſtemper,</hi> the <hi>phrenſie</hi> of the <hi>ſoule; repentance</hi> brings a man to his <hi>right</hi> minde, it brings him to <hi>himſelfe:</hi> Sinne is an <hi>aberration</hi> from the <hi>marke</hi> (ſo ſome words in Scripture ſignifie) <hi>repentance</hi> on the contrarie, it takes the <hi>point</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> which is the <hi>arrow</hi> that we ſhoot up to Heaven in the ſacrifice of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and it turns it juſt upon the <hi>marke</hi> againe; it ſets it right, to aime on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the <hi>glorie</hi> of God; that wee may <hi>gloriſie God</hi> in the <hi>latter</hi> part of our life, as we have <hi>diſhonoured</hi> him in the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: repentance</hi> is a directing to the right marke.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Sinne is a <hi>deviation,</hi> a turning out of the path of <hi>obedience,</hi> and from the commandements: <hi>repentance</hi> (and ſo the word is here uſed) is a <hi>turning</hi> to the <hi>right</hi> way, a bringing of our feet to that path, that God hath chalked to us. <hi>Repentance,</hi> as it is a <hi>generall turning,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>ſubject,</hi> ſo it is <hi>totall</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>act.</hi> That is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as it is <hi>totall</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>act;</hi> ſo it is finall in reſpect of the time. True repentance leaves ſinne: ſo as that it takes a long farewell, it takes its great, and laſt adieu of ſinne, it ſaith with the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles, I have put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I now defile them?</hi> I have found the ſmart of ſin, I have put off the garment of the old man: the Serpents ſkin is now gone, I am made partaker of the fleece of the <hi>Lamb:</hi> there is another garment of the robe of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is drawne over me; ſhall I take my old <hi>raggs</hi> againe? ſhall I take that which I have put <hi>off?</hi> I have ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed my feet, my affections; <hi>I have waſhed my hands in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie;</hi> I have waſhed my heart in the laver of epen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with that laver that begot repentance, the blood of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114893:33"/>ſhall I defile my ſelfe any more in the wayes and workes of ſinne? this is the language of repentance, it leaves ſinne, to turne no more to it.</p>
                  <p>Here in a true convert differs from a <hi>formall Chriſtian;</hi> he will turne for a time, when Gods hand preſſeth him; when he is driven to an exigent, and etremitie, he will leave his ſinne, but as a man puts off his garments at night, when he goes to bed, to take them when he awakes. He leaves ſinne in the night of affliction, and tribulation, but when the ſtorm's over, he takes it againe to himſelfe. Such Chriſt ſpeakes of in the Goſpell; they are compared to <hi>dogs</hi> and to <hi>ſwine,</hi> to <hi>dogs</hi> that returne to their <hi>vomit,</hi> and to <hi>ſwine,</hi> that returne to wallow in the <hi>myre,</hi> ſcuh as the Apoſtle ſaith, that having eſcaped the intanglements of the world, are defiled again the ſecond time. Such a one was <hi>Lots</hi> Wife that turned from <hi>Sodome,</hi> but looked back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: ſuch a one was <hi>Demas,</hi> that left the fellowſhip of the <hi>world,</hi> and imbraced the fellowſhip of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> but his reſolution held not out, after, he left the fellowſhip of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and betooke himſelfe to communion with the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, a true penitent doth not ſo, after he hath taſted once of the ſweetnes of grace, after he hath gotten aſſurance of the pardon of ſinne, it begets in him ſuch a deteſtation and hatred, that though he fall into any of thoſe ſinnes that coſt him the <hi>plowing up of his fallow ground,</hi> and the breaking of his heart, he would not change the comfort of his eſtate, for the pleaſures of all ſinnes, though they were not for a ſeaſon, but for <hi>eternitie:</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a finall change, ſo we ſee the phraſe cleared; repentance, and prayer is a turning.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet ſaith, <hi>Turne to the Lord,</hi> that is, turne your <hi>lips</hi> to him, offer the ſacrifice of <hi>praiſe;</hi> and turne your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114893:33"/>
                     <hi>hearts</hi> to him too, offer the ſacrifice of a <hi>contrite</hi> ſpirit: ſo much for the meaning of the phraſe.</p>
                  <p>I come to the ſecond, that is, the Propoſitions that ariſe from this dutie of action. The propoſitions are two that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe clearely.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Propoſition is this, that</p>
                  <q>In publique calamities that are threatned, or ſent upon a Land, there is no hope of having the judgement or puniſhment removed, except there be a turning to God by prayer.</q>
                  <p>The Prophet ſaw the <hi>judgement,</hi> and their <hi>miſerie,</hi> and he chalks out the meanes to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt meanes is this, the <hi>turning</hi> to the Lord, that is the ſumme of all; there is no hope of removing the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except wee turne te God by prayer. That is the firſt, and that is the way that the Scripture chalks out to us in diverſe places after a diverſe manner.</p>
                  <p>It ſhewes it us ſometimes, by vertue of the <hi>precept</hi> God hath commanded us, <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee:</hi> when trouble is nigh at hand, when any <hi>affliction</hi> perplexeth thee, when thou groaneſt under any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, loe God himſelfe ſhewes thee the way, and that is this, <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> that is, pray to me, <hi>turne</hi> to me by <hi>prayer:</hi> that which he cals there <hi>Call upon me</hi> is here <hi>Turne to the Lord;</hi> they are both phraſes equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</p>
                  <p>It is not only by <hi>precept,</hi> but it is ſet out by <hi>promiſe,</hi> the Scripture chalks out this by promiſe, take one for all 2 <hi>Chren.</hi> 7. That will ſuit with our occaſion, and this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There God makes this promiſe, <hi>If I ſhut heaven, that there be no raine, or if I command the locuſts to devoure the Land, or if I ſend the peſtilence that it break forth: If yet they ſhall turne to me, and ſeeke my face, and pray to me, and forſake their evill wayes, I will heare from Heaven, and pardon their ſins, and heale their Land.</hi> There could not be a more gracious promiſe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114893:34"/>nor a more <hi>ample</hi> promiſe, it is not only in <hi>generall,</hi> if that my judgements ſhall break forth on them: for then, it may be, they would have wanted underſtanding to have apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in <hi>particular</hi> judgements: therefore God inſtances in ſuch, and ſuch judgements; they may ſtand for all; in time of <hi>famine,</hi> and <hi>drought,</hi> if there be no <hi>raine;</hi> and if becauſe there be no raine, there is no <hi>plentie;</hi> if they be not only in <hi>famine,</hi> but <hi>peſtilence,</hi> he ſets the meanes, whereby he will be induced to withdraw theſe judgements, <hi>If they ſeeke my face and turne to me, and call upon my name, and forſake their evill wayes.</hi> There are all the particulars of dutie. Then there are all the particulars of <hi>deliverance, I will heare from Heaven, and pardon their ſinnes, and heale their Land:</hi> that is, I will remove the <hi>judgements,</hi> and not only ſo; but take them to <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> ſo, it is chalked out by promiſe as well as by precept.</p>
                  <p>Nay, not only by <hi>promiſe,</hi> but it is chalked out, by <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> and <hi>experience:</hi> take <hi>Davids</hi> experience for all, for <hi>David was one that</hi> ſhewed more experience of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods wayes then any other.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is the experience of his owne perſon, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. <hi>When I was in diſtreſſe, I called upon the Lord, I cried to God, and he heard me out of his holy Temple, and my crie entred into his eares.</hi> See, <hi>David</hi> in diſtreſſe called upon the Lord, and he heard him.</p>
                  <p>If we will not believe his experience for himſelfe, let us ſee it for others. That he ſets down in diverſe pſalines in generall words, that <hi>The righteous crye and the Lord heares them, and delivers them from all their troubles.</hi> The order is this, when the <hi>righteous</hi> are in <hi>trouble,</hi> they crye to the Lord, and he <hi>heares</hi> them, and his <hi>hearing</hi> is his <hi>anſwer,</hi> and his <hi>anſwer</hi> is <hi>deliverance</hi> out of trouble.</p>
                  <p>See yet, if the generall will not ſerve; if <hi>Davids</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will not ſerve, ſee it in particular Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>This
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114893:34"/>poore man cryed to the Lord.</hi> It is worth obſerving, that <hi>David</hi> breakes out into ſuch an abruption of phraſe; he named none before, if he had ſpoken before of one of exceeding pietie, and predicated this of him, <hi>This pooro man,</hi> wee might ſay as the Eunuch to <hi>Philip, Doth the Prophet ſpeake this of himſelfe, or of ſome other man?</hi> but it is a phraſe ordinarie in the Pſalmes, therefore take notice of it; it is in another Pſalme, <hi>Her foundations are upon the holic hill;</hi> a man would wonder who he ſpeakes of; but he knew wee muſt needs underſtand it of the <hi>Church:</hi> therefore as in an holy rapture, and ſpeaking of Gods government of it, he ſaith <hi>Her foundations,</hi> ye know whom I ſpeake of. So in another Pſalme, <hi>the Lord heare thee in the day of trouble;</hi> one would have thought he had ſpoken of ſome body before, the Lord hear <hi>thee, thee afflicted poor ſoule,</hi> whoſoever, <hi>In the day of trouble, the Lord heare thee:</hi> ſo, <hi>This poore man.</hi> I know ſome interpret it in reference to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> therefore they make it a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Gods hearing of Chriſts prayer upon the croſſe, and in the garden; ſome of the antients interpret it ſo: but yet it runs more directly concerning <hi>righteous</hi> men, according to the phraſe of Scripture, <hi>This poore man;</hi> that is, any <hi>poore</hi> man, any righteous man: it is as much, as <hi>The righteous crie, and the Lord hears them: This psore man cried, and the Lord heard him;</hi> that is, <hi>whoſoever</hi> is in <hi>distreſſe,</hi> and <hi>perplexitie,</hi> if he <hi>ſeeke</hi> to God, God will <hi>heare</hi> him, and deliver him. Wee ſee it by <hi>experience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we may ſee it by example too. The examples are many in Scripture, I will inſtance only in three; that this hath alway been the courſe that the <hi>Saints</hi> of God, nay, that even <hi>wicked</hi> men have tooke in the time of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, and <hi>diſtreſſe</hi> to flie to the Throne of grrace, and to <hi>turne</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by prayer. <hi>Moſes,</hi> when God ſayd he had a purpoſe to deſtroy the congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114893:35"/>them in a moment, preſently he betakes himſelfe to his knees, and he ſpeakes to God, <hi>O Lord this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have committed a great ſinne:</hi> it was the courſe that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> tooke too, when he ſaw the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Lord with his ſword drawn over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> readie to deſtroy it, <hi>It is I that have ſinned;</hi> it was the courſe that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> tooke, when he had a Meſſage of death brought to him, <hi>He turned to the wall,</hi> ſaith the Text, and ſaid to God, <hi>O Lord remember how I have walked before thee with a perfect heart:</hi> he turned to the <hi>Wall,</hi> that is, he <hi>ſequeſtred</hi> himſelf from <hi>earthly</hi> occaſions that he might <hi>Turne to the Lord,</hi> with more libertie of Spirit, and largeneſſe of heart. It was the courſe that <hi>Manaſſes</hi> tooke, that <hi>filled Jeruſalem</hi> with <hi>blood,</hi> when he was in chaines, and captivitie, and affliction, he <hi>turned to the Lord, and called upon him, and humbled himſelfe greatly:</hi> it was the courſe that the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi> tooke in the new Teſtament, when he had not bread to eate, he ſaith, <hi>I will goe to my Father,</hi> that is, I will <hi>turne</hi> to my <hi>Father, and ſay, Father I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee:</hi> we ſee it confirmed by example, there cannot be more ſaid.</p>
                  <p>To confirme it by reaſon: for this is the moſt <hi>eaſie,</hi> and the moſt <hi>equall,</hi> and the moſt ſucceſſefull, and moſt poſſible courſe of diverting any ill wee are in, or in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of. It is the moſt <hi>equall</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> courſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>God</hi> is the perſon that is <hi>provoked</hi> by us: he is the <hi>Judge</hi> that ſends the puniſhment, it is his <hi>Law</hi> that is <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> his <hi>name</hi> that is diſhonoured: to whom ſhould wee goe but to him that wee have provoked by our ſinnes?</p>
                  <p>It is not poſſible, that the turning away of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be by any other way, <hi>Vaine is the helpe of man:</hi> it is not in the <hi>Arme of fleſh,</hi> to ſave any one from that judgement that God ſends. There is no care, no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114893:35"/>providence, no foreſight of man can divert judgement: we muſt have recourſe to God.</p>
                  <p>And it is the moſt <hi>ſucceſſefull</hi> way of all other; no man can inſtance in any example of any ſoule that ever <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>prayer,</hi> in the time of diſtreſſe, but if God ſaw it needfull in his wiſedome to turne away <hi>plague</hi> or <hi>famine,</hi> he turned it away. <hi>Prayer</hi> is the moſt <hi>readie,</hi> and the moſt equall way.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Prayer</hi> is the moſt <hi>eaſie</hi> way: can any man deſire to have a bleſſing upon eaſier tearmes, then to <hi>aske</hi> and <hi>have?</hi> to <hi>turn</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and to have him <hi>turne</hi> to <hi>us?</hi> to turn to God, &amp; have his judgements turned from us? that is the firſt Propoſition; there is no hope of turning away calamities over us, but by turning to God by <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is no hope of diverting <hi>judgements,</hi> but by <hi>turning</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>repentance;</hi> that is the ſecond, <hi>Turne</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>turne</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>repentance,</hi> or elſe <hi>prayer</hi> will not ſerve without <hi>repentance, If I regard iniquitie in my heart, the Lord wll not heare my prayer.</hi> The <hi>prayer</hi> of <hi>ſinners</hi> is oft times accepted, but it is of <hi>penitent</hi> ſinners; but the prayer of ſinne never: the hands of the <hi>blaſphemer,</hi> and the <hi>eyes</hi> of the Adulterer, that looke to Heaven, God lookes with indignation upon ſuch hands, and eyes, and hearts; we muſt <hi>purge</hi> our hearts from wickedneſſe, if we will <hi>turne</hi> to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two cannot ſtand together, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>ſinne,</hi> as on the other ſide, <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>impenitencie</hi> cannot ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe <hi>pardon</hi> belongs to <hi>repentance:</hi> ſo <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> cannot ſtand together, the one takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the other: ſinne removes repentance, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance removes ſinne; <hi>ſinne</hi> makes a <hi>ſeperation</hi> betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>us, repentance</hi> knits us againe, the one <hi>deſtroyes</hi> the other; ſinne makes God turne from the purpoſe of of <hi>mercie; Your ſinnes have withheld good things from you:</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:114893:36"/>this I did to you, and would have done more, but for your <hi>tranſgreſſions:</hi> ſin makes God turn from the purpoſe of mercie; on the other ſide, <hi>repentance</hi> makes God <hi>turn</hi> from the purpoſe of judgement.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Sinne</hi> never meets with pardon, that is, <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitencie;</hi> though <hi>ſinne</hi> meet with <hi>pardon, impenitencie</hi> doth not: it ſets a man further from God then ſinne, when its firſt committed. It is worſe to goe on in ſinne, then to commit it: But repentance alway hath pardon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>repentance</hi> never miſſeth of <hi>forgiveneſſe;</hi> if we <hi>turne</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> he is alway readie to turne to us. See in that place of the Pſalme. <hi>The Lord is nigh to all that call upon him, to thoſe that are of a broken heart, and he ſaves them that be of a contrite Spirt.</hi> Yet plainer in 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. <hi>If ye will turne to the Lord, the Lord will not turne his face from you:</hi> yet againe, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. <hi>Hate the evill, and ſeeke the good, it may be the Lord will be gracious to the remnant of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> that is, <hi>peradventure</hi> he will.</p>
                  <p>Some may ſay, here is ſome hope, ſome comfort, but here is no aſſurance: there is no aſſurance in this place <hi>The Lord is nigh;</hi> he may be <hi>nigh,</hi> he is nigh to all, he may be nigh to me, but yet it may be he will not <hi>turne</hi> to me in mercie: it may be he may be too neare me, as when he ſends judgements, what comfort have I by that promiſe, <hi>the Lord is nigh?</hi> I have leſſe comfort by that, <hi>It may be he will turne.</hi> Is ſalvation promiſed with <hi>it may be? It may be God will be gratious?</hi> There is but little comfort in that, <hi>Turne from your evill wayes, and God will not turne away his face.</hi> He hath turned away his face al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, I would have him turne againe; he will not turne from me, but will he turne againe? I, but if thoſe places will not doe it, we will finde thoſe places that ſhall doe it to purpoſe, for though in the Pſalme he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114893:36"/>ſaith the Lord is nigh, yet in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. <hi>Let the wicked man forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his evill thoughts,</hi> well, and then forward, <hi>For he is readie to forgive, and will abundantly pardon.</hi> He will not only come nigh us, but forgive us, he will not only pardon us, but <hi>abundantly</hi> pardon. There is not only a little turning <hi>towards</hi> us, but a turning <hi>to</hi> us, and a turning in <hi>mercie,</hi> and in <hi>much</hi> mercie.</p>
                  <p>And againe, where it is ſaid, God will not turne his face from them, and in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 18. it is ſaid more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will not only, not turne from them, but he will directly to them. <hi>If I pronounce judgement againſt a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they turne from their evill wayes, and turne to me, I will repent of the evill I thought to bring upon them:</hi> God condiſcends not only to <hi>returne,</hi> but in our language he condiſcends; he cals upon us to <hi>repent,</hi> and he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to <hi>repent:</hi> it is impoſſible he ſhould repent proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he cannot change, but his repenting is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to ours; if wee returne wicked man forſake he will turne from the evill of puniſhment, if we repent of our actions, he will repent of his purpoſe, if they <hi>turn</hi> to me, I will returne to them; there is more then not to turne from them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, where it is ſaid in <hi>Amos, It may be the Lord will be mercifull:</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. it is a certainty, God wil certainely be mercifull; <hi>If the wicked man forſake his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes, he ſhall ſurely live, and not dye.</hi> I will ſpare his <hi>life,</hi> he ſhall live and not dye: ſo you ſee plainly, God hath promiſed to <hi>turne,</hi> and to turne abundantly, and in mercie to the penitent heart that turnes to him. Thereupon thoſe Phraſes are ſo oft in Scripture, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. <hi>Mall.</hi> 3. <hi>Turne to me, and I will turne to you:</hi> God conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I will come as farre to meet you, as you ſhall to meet me, I will take as much <hi>paines</hi> to ſave you, as you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114893:37"/>ſhall to ſave your ſelves, nay I will prevent you, I will <hi>turne</hi> to you firſt, and make you <hi>returne</hi> to me, turne to me that I may ſave you; God capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, as if it were an arbitration; how long will ye ſtand upon termes? I will condiſcend, let us meete one another halfe way, <hi>Turne to me:</hi> it is not for my good that I expect it, but for yours; turne to me, and I will turne to you.</p>
                  <p>And for your better incouragement, you ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>repentance</hi> alwayes meets with <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne, and <hi>reverſion</hi> of judgements: the impenitent never meets with <hi>pardon,</hi> when a man continues in ſinne: in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>The righteous man if he forſake his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and betake himſelfe to a courſe of ſinne; as a <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> man when he <hi>converts,</hi> he ſhall <hi>live,</hi> and not dye: ſo a <hi>righteous</hi> man when he turnes to ſinne, he ſhall dye and not live; and <hi>The Lord will breake the hairie ſcalp off him that goes on in ſin;</hi> that is, the Lord will pour judgments, heavie judgements, that ſhall fetch off <hi>haire</hi> and <hi>head,</hi> and all; he will ſtrike him in his <hi>vitals:</hi> the Lord will breake the <hi>ſcalpe</hi> of him, not that <hi>commits,</hi> but that <hi>goes on</hi> in ſinne, that is, of <hi>impenitent</hi> men: it is impenitencie that brings judgements upon men, or Kingdomes; for a man to thinke that he may <hi>continue</hi> in ſinne, and yet God will turne away his judgements, it is <hi>preſumption:</hi> that is to <hi>make God a Lyar;</hi> it is to make God a <hi>breaker</hi> of his owne <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>rule.</hi> Wee read that God <hi>turned,</hi> and had mercie, but they ſtill turned to him. For, that of <hi>Ahab,</hi> we reade that God ſayd concerning <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he would not bring <hi>the evill in Ahabs dayes,</hi> as he had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but the Text ſaith, that <hi>Ahab humbled himſelfe.</hi> There is hope, it may be, ſaith <hi>Amos,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> found it was ſo, he humbled himſelfe, and God turned from his judgement.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114893:37"/>Wee reade the ſame of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> when God denounced judgement againſt it, yet <hi>Forty dayes and Niniveh ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> yet after, God gave them a longer time, forty dayes, and forty dayes, and forty yeares, even after his owne word was gone out: but withall, we reade that <hi>Niniveh</hi> turned from their ſinnes, and repented in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath and Aſhes: ſo we reade of <hi>Iſrael, Judg.</hi> 10. after God had denounced judgement, it is ſaid there, <hi>That God was grieved at the heart, becauſe of their oppreſſion;</hi> he began to <hi>repent,</hi> as when a man repents, there is <hi>griefe</hi> of heart joyned with repentance: ſo God, <hi>He was grieved at the heart, becauſe of Iſrael:</hi> but we reade that <hi>They put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their ſtrange gods,</hi> and <hi>confeſſed</hi> of themſelves that they had done <hi>wickedly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is an inſtance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> God ſaith concerning him, and the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> that he would not bring thoſe judgements, that he threatned againſt them, and that he would deliver them, and give them <hi>ſucceſſe;</hi> but wee reade withall, that they confeſſed their ſinnes before God, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord is righteous:</hi> ſtill where there is <hi>removing</hi> of <hi>judgement,</hi> there is <hi>leaving</hi> of <hi>ſinne,</hi> and there is <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot gather, that becauſe God is mercifull to the <hi>penitent,</hi> he will to the <hi>impenitent;</hi> it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a <hi>vaine</hi> thing, as well as a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to thinke that God will ceaſe correcting, if we do not ceaſe committing, to think that God ſhould <hi>change,</hi> that is not capable of change, that he ſhould change his purpoſe of <hi>judgement,</hi> that is immutable, and we not change our purpoſe of <hi>ſinne,</hi> and going on in ſinne, that are made of <hi>change.</hi> Tell me if itſtand not with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that <hi>man</hi> ſhould <hi>change,</hi> that is made <hi>changeable,</hi> rather then wee ſhould hope, that God ſhould change,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114893:38"/>that is not <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>change?</hi> but then he is ſaid to <hi>change,</hi> when he changeth <hi>us,</hi> and makes us <hi>better;</hi> when men are under <hi>affliction,</hi> and he ſends them <hi>proſperitie;</hi> when men are under the weight of <hi>ſinne</hi> before, and he ſends them ſalvation; when he workes this <hi>change,</hi> God is ſaid to <hi>change:</hi> therefore the <hi>change</hi> muſt be on <hi>our part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this makes me thinke, that this <hi>poyſoned arrow,</hi> that deſtroyes by <hi>night,</hi> and kils by <hi>day,</hi> this arrow of the <hi>peſtilence,</hi> that runs through our <hi>ſtreets,</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> and <hi>Townes,</hi> that takes ſo great a flight from the <hi>mother</hi> Cities, to the <hi>Daughter</hi> Cities, that flies in a <hi>moment,</hi> not only a <hi>few miles,</hi> but many, and picks out this <hi>Citie,</hi> and that Towne, and that Countrie, and this ſtreet in a Cicie, and this houſe in a ſtreet. It makes me thinke that that <hi>ſword</hi> will be made more ſharpe before God put it up, and that <hi>arrow</hi> head will be poyſoned more before God call it back: why? becauſe there is no thought of <hi>repenting:</hi> ſo farre are we from <hi>turning,</hi> that wee have not yet learned to play the <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> wee are not come ſo farre as the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> we are not come ſo farre as to diſſigure our faces. There is no man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>turnes</hi> his <hi>countenance,</hi> that <hi>turnes</hi> his <hi>eye</hi> to the ground. We are <hi>ſmitten,</hi> but we are not <hi>ſenſible,</hi> Gods hand <hi>preſſeth</hi> us, but we are not <hi>humbled:</hi> the <hi>Fan</hi> is ſent out, but we are not <hi>winnowed:</hi> wee are a corrupt floore, and a corrupt generation that goe on ſtill.

                  </p>
                  <p>I may aske <hi>Chriſoſtomes</hi> queſtion, that he asked the people of <hi>Antioch;</hi> who is there among us all that his heart <hi>ſmites</hi> him? who is there among us all that once <hi>grieves</hi> for ſinne? that once <hi>ſmites on his Thigh,</hi>

Nay, wee may ſay, as the Prophet of the people of <hi>Iſraell, Jer.</hi> 3. <hi>I called, but they would not turne,</hi> and in <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. <hi>I hearkned and heard,</hi> to ſee if there were any that would leave their wicked wayes; but <hi>behold there was no man,</hi> they all went on in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their owne hearts, and <hi>none ſaid, what have I done?</hi> Or as the houſe of <hi>Judah.

It is the anſwer that wee returne generally to God, though we ſay it not with our lips, we reſolve to walke according to the <hi>deviſes</hi> of our owne <hi>hearts:</hi> and what are thoſe? the <hi>deviſes</hi> of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>vanitie,</hi> of <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>iniquitie,</hi> and of <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>reviling</hi> one another: and theſe are the <hi>devices</hi> of our owne <hi>hearts,</hi> not the deviſes of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> and of his law; and theſe are the anſwers that we returne, <hi>Nay, but we will walke according to the deviſes of our owne hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot tell into what principle I ſhall reſolve, what ſhould be the cauſe of ſo much impenitencie and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

It can be nothing but the Spirit of <hi>ſecuritie,</hi> and <hi>drowſineſſe,</hi> that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeakes of, that poſſeſſeth us, <hi>The Spirit of ſlumber is on them, and they have cloſed the eyes of their underſtanding.</hi> Wee <hi>ſleepe,</hi> and promiſe our ſelves good dayes, when God pronounceth <hi>evill.</hi> It were well if it were no more but a Spirit of <hi>ſlumber,</hi> there might be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114893:39"/>
                     <hi>hope</hi> that we ſhould <hi>awake,</hi> but it is as a Spirit of <hi>deriſion,</hi> of <hi>ſcorne,</hi> like <hi>Job's horſe, that laughs at deſtruction, we laugh when our feare cometh:</hi> and as his horſe is deſcribed there; ſo men goe on in ſin, they <hi>ruſh into the battell,</hi> though they be to encounter with <hi>God,</hi> as if they were able to meet with judgements.</p>
                  <p>I have oft wondred, that upon all thoſe inducements to ſeeke <hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> that men ſhould <hi>neglect</hi> it ſo much, and I ſee the reaſon is, becauſe men love life temporall, better then eternall: <hi>earth</hi> is <hi>heaven, this</hi> world is better then the other, yet that is ſome reaſon, becauſe this life hath ſom what ſenſible, and we are lead by ſenſe; it muſt be a heart of faith that lookes after the <hi>other</hi> life, <hi>ſenſible</hi> men will looke to <hi>this</hi> life.</p>
                  <p>But this I wonder at, that men ſhould not only love <hi>temporall</hi> life better then <hi>eternall,</hi> but that men ſhould love ſinne better then <hi>life.</hi> There is nothing that a man hath in this world better then life, he will part with <hi>skin for skin, arme</hi> after <hi>arme, thouſands</hi> after <hi>thouſands,</hi> with <hi>eye,</hi> and <hi>skin,</hi> and <hi>arme,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> to ſave his <hi>life;</hi> ſhall we be willing to part with thoſe, and not with <hi>ſinne</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>ſinne?</hi> were it once ſaid, and all that a man had <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</hi> would he give for his <hi>life,</hi> it were ſomething, if we would part with <hi>ſinne</hi> after <hi>ſinne;</hi> no, but wee love ſinne beter then life, and that is the reaſon, though wee be in danger, we goe on in ſinne. Remember the voyce of him that calleth, God could not propound to you a more gracious way, <hi>turne</hi> by <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> There are many bonds that will put us upon it.</p>
                  <p>The bond of <hi>nature</hi> cals upon us: all <hi>creatures turne</hi> to God, the <hi>inſenſible</hi> creatures; the <hi>Ravens,</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> they <hi>turne</hi> to God, and ſeeke their <hi>meat</hi> of him; ſhall we be more inſenſible then they?</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no commendable <hi>vertue,</hi> but it is beſet with <hi>extreames</hi> on <hi>both</hi> hands, one on the <hi>right</hi> hand, and another on the <hi>left.</hi> For <hi>morall</hi> vertues it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and for <hi>naturall</hi> habits, whether they be <hi>outward,</hi> or <hi>inward,</hi> we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance but in one for all; that is, The gift of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> it hath extreames that hedge it in both wayes: There is one extreame in the <hi>defect,</hi> that is, <hi>Silence;</hi> and of that it is that the Prophet accuſeth the Shepheards of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they did betray the ſalvation of the people by their <hi>ſilence,</hi> they were as <hi>dumb Dogs that could not bark.</hi> And the other extreame is, in <hi>exceſſe,</hi> and that is called <hi>much ſpeaking,</hi> and of that <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, <hi>in multiloquio, &amp;c. In the multitude of words there never wants ſin:</hi> It is ſo in <hi>naturall</hi> language, and in <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> kinde of <hi>ſpeech;</hi> and it is ſo alſo in the <hi>ſpirituall</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:114893:42"/>language, and in the conference we have with God. Prayer is the language of the <hi>heart,</hi> and it hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames on <hi>both</hi> hands: For the extreame that is in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,</hi> Chriſt toucheth it in the Goſpell, he tells us of the Phariſees, that <hi>thought they ſhould be heard for their long prayers, and much babling;</hi> that is one fault. And for the extremity in the <hi>defect,</hi> we have it in <hi>Job</hi> 21. and <hi>Job</hi> 32. where he complaines of <hi>prophane</hi> perſons, thoſe that God was not in their <hi>thoughts,</hi> and ſo not in their <hi>tongue,</hi> to ſpeak of him with reverence, <hi>Who is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty that we ſhould ſerve him? or what helpe is there in the Lord that we ſhould pray to him?</hi> The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were guilty of both theſe extreames, and that kept them that they could not hit the <hi>mediocrity,</hi> to obſerve a good <hi>decorum</hi> in prayer to God: For the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of their <hi>words,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſets it down, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. they were come to that height, they durſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with God: <hi>Yee have robbed me, ſaith God:</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>Wherein have we robbed thee? Yee have ſpoken ſtoutly, ſaith God:</hi> They reply, <hi>Wherein?</hi> They had words whereby to <hi>diſhonour</hi> God, and none to <hi>pleaſe,</hi> or to <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie</hi> him. And for the <hi>defect</hi> of ſpeech in the grace of <hi>prayer,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 64. that <hi>hee looked about and found none,</hi> that did apply themſelves to <hi>call upon God, or to lay hold of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not uſuall for a man to be guilty of <hi>both</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames in the ſame kinde of ſin; becauſe that <hi>extreams</hi> are contrary one to another; yet they had a double guilt upon themſelves, they were <hi>full</hi> of <hi>words</hi> in <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> matters, but altogether <hi>ſilent</hi> and <hi>dumbe</hi> towards <hi>ſalvation.</hi> To ſpeake againſt God, ſo they abounded with <hi>words,</hi> and yet to ſpeak <hi>to him</hi> to <hi>pacifie him,</hi> ſo they wanted them. Therefore it is this infirmity the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> here labours to cure in this people. He
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114893:42"/>obſerved their <hi>defect,</hi> he ſaw how they <hi>turned</hi> aſide; but they would not lay hold on the meanes of <hi>pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> therefore now he directs them to ſee the right way, whence they ſhould take their beginning to work <hi>attonement,</hi> and <hi>reconciliation</hi> with God. He ſpeakes <hi>Ephata,</hi> he puts his finger (as it were) to their mouths to open them, to unbowell their hearts with the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement</hi> of their <hi>ſins,</hi> with the in larging of their petitions to God; and thus he counſells them, <hi>Take with you words, and turne to the Lord, and ſay,</hi> thus and thus.</p>
                  <p>You may remember how I divided the words, they containe two things:</p>
                  <p>The forme of an <hi>excitement:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And a forme of <hi>direction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The forme of <hi>excitement</hi> in the firſt part, that is to <hi>two</hi> duties.</p>
                  <p>One to the duty of action, <hi>Turne to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another to the duty of elocution, <hi>Take to you words,</hi> and ſpeak to him.</p>
                  <p>Of the former I ſpake in the Forenoone, reading the words ſo, <hi>Turne to the Lord,</hi> and in turning, <hi>take to you words:</hi> And there I ſhewed you what was the <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of this exhortation; what was the <hi>reaſon</hi> he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the exhortation <hi>twice</hi> upon them, of <hi>turning</hi> to the Lord, what are the <hi>duties</hi> he aimes at: To ſtirr them up to the work of <hi>prayer,</hi> that is one kinde of <hi>turning;</hi> to ſtirr them up to the work of <hi>repentance,</hi> that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of <hi>turning</hi> to the Lord: An <hi>univerſall</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in reſpect of the <hi>ſubject,</hi> a <hi>totall</hi> turning in reſpect of the <hi>act;</hi> a <hi>finall</hi> turning in reſpect of the <hi>time,</hi> never to look on ſin againe. What the <hi>propoſitions</hi> were that aroſe hence, That there is no <hi>diverſion</hi> of <hi>judgements</hi> without <hi>turning</hi> to God by <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>turning</hi> to God
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114893:43"/>by <hi>repentance;</hi> there is no true <hi>repentance</hi> without ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away <hi>ſin.</hi> This is the ſumm of that I delivered in the forenoone.</p>
                  <p>Now I goe on, that is, to the <hi>ſecond excitement,</hi> to which here the Prophet would provoke and ſtirr them, and that is, to the duty of <hi>elocution:</hi> In the former he ſhewed them the way, what courſe they muſt take to <hi>God, Turne to him:</hi> In this he ſhewes them the way, what courſe they muſt take for <hi>repentance, Take words</hi> to themſelves.</p>
                  <q>Take to you words.</q>
                  <p>There is no difficulty in the <hi>meaning</hi> of the phraſe, there can be nothing more familer to us then that phraſe, which intreats of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> and taking of <hi>words,</hi> which is onely proper to <hi>man:</hi> Yet I finde that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters make a little difference in the expoſition of them.</p>
                  <p>For ſome will have this to be the meaning that the Prophet here excites them to a duty of <hi>obedience, Take to you words:</hi> Here me now when I ſpeake to you in theſe words: That is the expoſition of <hi>Mercer</hi> and <hi>Zanche,</hi> liſten to <hi>my words</hi> when I exhort you to <hi>repent</hi> and turne to the Lord; that is the meaning of that phraſe: But others better, that the Prophet excites them here to a duty of <hi>expreſſion</hi> of their <hi>repentance,</hi> that that would kindle in them the flame of all good <hi>deſires,</hi> by getting a wholeſome <hi>forme of ſpeech</hi> to come before God: So the meaning is, <hi>Take to you words; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> your ſelves before God, flye to him by <hi>prayer,</hi> ſeeke <hi>reconciliation</hi> at his hands; but take heed that you come not <hi>unprepared, unprovided; fit</hi> your ſelves well before, and <hi>ſtudy</hi> how to ſpeak to him, <hi>Take words,</hi> and then goe to him, and <hi>turne:</hi> This I take to be the more <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:114893:43"/>expoſition, more <hi>genuine:</hi> For if we inſiſt in the <hi>other,</hi> the phraſe of ſpeech will not <hi>beare</hi> it, it offers <hi>violence</hi> to the Text; it is not onely <hi>diverſe,</hi> but <hi>repugnant;</hi> for if that were the meaning, <hi>Take to you words,</hi> that is, heare <hi>my words;</hi> the Prophet would not have exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to have gotten <hi>lips,</hi> but <hi>eares,</hi> not <hi>words,</hi> but <hi>attention:</hi> He doth not here exhort them ſo much to <hi>liſten</hi> to him, as to <hi>open</hi> their owne mouthes to God. Therefore of neceſſity we muſt take it as the words lye, for the procurement of the language of <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> which will be moſt fit for the expreſſion of their <hi>repentance</hi> to God: So taking this thus, there are theſe two things to be conſidered in this part.</p>
                  <p>One is the <hi>getting</hi> of words.</p>
                  <p>Another is for the <hi>uttering</hi> and <hi>expreſſing</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, in thoſe words, <hi>Take to you words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond, in the other, <hi>And ſay to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I ſhall onely ſpeak of the former at this time; that is, of the words they ſhould take to themſelves.</p>
                  <q>Take to you words.</q>
                  <p>It hath reſpect to the former duty I ſpake of in <hi>both</hi> the acceptions, <hi>Turne to the Lord,</hi> turne by <hi>prayer,</hi> turne by <hi>repentance,</hi> both wayes it looks: When you <hi>pray</hi> to God, then get <hi>words,</hi> when you <hi>repent</hi> of your ſinnes, then get <hi>words:</hi> It is the obſervation both of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> he ſtirres them up that they ſhould bring with them, <hi>Non aurum, non argentum, non oblatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſed preces;</hi> he calls to them not to bring their <hi>Gold,</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> to Gods Treaſury, not to bring their <hi>Sheep,</hi> or <hi>Oxen</hi> to his <hi>Altar;</hi> God was weary of thoſe <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> he looked for <hi>repentance,</hi> it was onely to bring <hi>words</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> in <hi>humbling</hi> themſelves and ſeeking <hi>mercy,</hi> and words of <hi>repentance</hi> in acknowledging their ſins;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114893:44"/>this was the ſcope the Prophet aymed at: So, I will conſider in it two things.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>motives</hi> that induced the Prophet to make this exhortation, he calls upon them for <hi>words,</hi> get you <hi>words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>ſcope</hi> he propounded to himſelfe in it, what is the <hi>duty</hi> he would excite them to.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>motive</hi> that induced the Prophet to make this exhortation here, for we have not the <hi>parallell</hi> to it in Scripture, <hi>Take to you words:</hi> It ſhould ſeem they were brought to a very low ebb for <hi>piety,</hi> that they knew not the firſt <hi>elements</hi> and <hi>principles;</hi> that they could not goe ſo farr as wicked <hi>Iſrael</hi> that would <hi>flatter God with their mouth:</hi> that they were ſo farr from true <hi>contrition,</hi> that they could not ſo much as bring <hi>words</hi> of <hi>confeſſion</hi> to acknowledge their ſins, though it were but from the teeth outward.</p>
                  <p>We know they were a people of another temper, the Pſalmiſt deſcribes them, they were a people given too much to words, the Iſraelites: In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. <hi>Their mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſſe, miſcheife and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is under their tongue. Pſal.</hi> 59. the Pſalmiſt ſaith, they uſed <hi>to belch out their words againſt God, Swords were in their mouthes;</hi> that is, they had all kinde of words but thoſe that they ſhould have, <hi>words</hi> of cruelty, <hi>Swords were in their tongues; words</hi> of deceit, <hi>the poyſon of Aſpes was under their lips; words</hi> of miſcheife, <hi>words</hi> of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God, and yet for <hi>words</hi> of devotion, and <hi>words</hi> of repentance, there their hearts were barren. It was their <hi>backwardneſſe</hi> to this duty the Prophet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and that made him frame this <hi>exhortation;</hi> they were <hi>backward</hi> to the worke of <hi>repentance,</hi> they hardly knew what it meant; ſome generall hints they had, that God was <hi>diſpleaſed,</hi> and was to be pacified, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114893:44"/>they had <hi>forſaken the Fountaine of living water:</hi> They knew how to bring words to <hi>Aſhtaroth,</hi> but not to come with words of <hi>repentance</hi> to the <hi>true God.</hi> There were many impediments that kept them from uſing <hi>words</hi> in <hi>prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Partly, they were afrayd by reaſon of their <hi>ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Partly, they were <hi>ignorant,</hi> they knew not how to endite their <hi>prayers,</hi> to frame their <hi>bill,</hi> when they ſhould preferr their <hi>ſuits</hi> to God.</p>
                  <p>Partly, their <hi>hearts</hi> were hardened, they were not touched within; <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> Where there is not <hi>repentance</hi> within, there are no words <hi>without:</hi> The Prophet obſerved all theſe <hi>defects,</hi> their backwardneſſe to this duty, that made him frame this exhortation, <hi>Take to you words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this was their caſe, <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>after,</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> we may ſee it out of diverſe places of Scripture. <hi>Before</hi> the time of this Prophet, ſee it in <hi>Job,</hi> ſee it in <hi>David: After</hi> the time of this Prophet we may ſee it in <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>I hearkened and heard, but there was none that turned to the Lord:</hi> He tooke a Candle to looke about him, and could not finde a man that knew how to <hi>pray</hi> to God: That it was ſo <hi>in</hi> the time of this Prophet, ſee it in <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 64. he lived in the ſame time with <hi>Hoſea, There is none that calls upon God, there is none that layes hold on him</hi> by prayer: The Prophet obſerved this well, that <hi>here</hi> was their errour and defect; hee might have ſayd of them, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith concerning his Freinds, <hi>I waited and expected if they would ſpeake</hi> to God, but I found they were all <hi>ſilent:</hi> The Prophet had long expected to ſee, if after all thoſe <hi>excitements</hi> they would yet <hi>turne,</hi> if they would yet <hi>learne</hi> to make but one forme of <hi>prayer,</hi> to <hi>humble</hi> themſelves but in the eyes of <hi>men;</hi> but afterward finding that yet they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114893:45"/>would not <hi>returne</hi> of <hi>themſelves,</hi> he could hold no <hi>longer,</hi> but provokes them to the practice of the <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> that they might now ſhew the language of <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>prayer, Take to you words:</hi> It is as much as if he had ſayd, How long will ye <hi>abſent</hi> your ſelves? Are ye not yet <hi>ſenſible?</hi> Neyther the <hi>judgements</hi> that are <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> nor the <hi>evills threatned,</hi> will not they yet move you? If yet they cannot <hi>ſtirr</hi> you up in your <hi>mindes</hi> to ſeek God, becauſe he is <hi>gracious,</hi> yet look to your <hi>ſelves,</hi> ſeek to him for your <hi>ſelves,</hi> becauſe you are <hi>miſerable:</hi> If you cannot come to him of your ſelves, come to me, I will <hi>learne</hi> you; if it be <hi>feare</hi> that keeps you back, I will <hi>embolden</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> you; though your <hi>ſins</hi> be many, God is <hi>gracious;</hi> though they be <hi>great,</hi> God is <hi>mercifull;</hi> if <hi>ignorance</hi> keep you back, come, <hi>hearken to me, I will teach you the feare of the Lord: Little Children,</hi> I will teach you to <hi>pray,</hi> and ſet you a forme of <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> though you cannot bring <hi>repentance</hi> in <hi>perfection,</hi> bring it in the <hi>principles;</hi> though the name <hi>of teares</hi> be yet unpleaſant to you, yet the name of <hi>words</hi> is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; what more eaſie then this? I call not now for the <hi>plowing up of your fallow ground,</hi> and the <hi>rending</hi> of your <hi>hearts,</hi> though God <hi>expect</hi> that, that you may come to that in <hi>time:</hi> All that I now require is, that you <hi>take words,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak</hi> to the Lord in this forme, <hi>Take to you words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So now in this part we may ſee there are two things <hi>commendable</hi> in this carriage of the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing that is <hi>commendable</hi> is this, that hee <hi>watcheth</hi> over them in their <hi>deficiencies,</hi> he hath an eye upon them, he ſtudyed where their <hi>imperfections</hi> lay, that he might apply himſelfe to <hi>cure</hi> them, that hee might lay on the <hi>ſalves:</hi> A <hi>Phiſitian</hi> who knowes not the cauſe, and the nature of the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> cannot apply a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114893:45"/>
                     <hi>remedy.</hi> The Prophet ſearcheth, and diggs for <hi>hardneſſe</hi> of heart in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and having found it, he applies the <hi>remedy;</hi> he watcheth over them in their <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>back-ſlyding.</hi> See <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> he tooke a Candle to <hi>ſee if there were a man; I hearkned and heard,</hi> ſaith he. It was the courſe that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> took: See <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 5. how he <hi>ſtudies</hi> the condition of the Churches he wrote to. Some were <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and he propounds the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God to them; ſome were <hi>weaker,</hi> and thoſe he comes to in <hi>elements,</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Doctrine:</hi> He comes to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> bringing the <hi>Milke</hi> of <hi>principles,</hi> and teaching <hi>them againe which were the firſt elements of Faith:</hi> It is the courſe that every good <hi>Miniſter</hi> takes; we ſhall never know the <hi>ſtate</hi> of our <hi>people,</hi> unleſſe we ſtudy their <hi>imperfections,</hi> and <hi>watch</hi> over them: How ſhall we know what <hi>Doctrines</hi> to deliver to you? It is a thing you deſire, to walke in <hi>clouds</hi> that we might not obſerve you in your imperfections; but that you may be raiſed out of <hi>ſin,</hi> give us leave to <hi>pry</hi> into them, to be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> to <hi>watch</hi> over our <hi>Flocks</hi> and <hi>Heards,</hi> to watch which way they <hi>walke,</hi> and how they <hi>thrive,</hi> and <hi>live,</hi> that we may know which is <hi>diſeaſed,</hi> which is <hi>wandring,</hi> and which is <hi>ſound,</hi> and which keeps in the <hi>Fold:</hi> That is the firſt thing in the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing <hi>commendable</hi> is, he doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>watch</hi> over their weakneſſe, but <hi>condiſcend</hi> to their infirmities, he <hi>applyes</hi> himſelfe to their <hi>temper:</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>And I brethren, when I came to you, I could not come to you as ſpirituall, but as carnall; babes in Chriſt:</hi> therefore I brought not <hi>ſtrong meat, but milke, becauſe you were not able to beare meat, nor are not yet:</hi> The Apoſtle condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends to their <hi>capacity,</hi> he ſaw the <hi>ſtate</hi> of their <hi>ſtomack</hi> what meat they could <hi>beare,</hi> and what they could not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114893:46"/>
                     <hi>digeſt,</hi> and he comes to them accordingly: So <hi>Hoſea</hi> here, hee obſerved that the people were not able to beare this ſtrong Doctrine of the depth of <hi>repentance;</hi> therefore he comes to them in the firſt <hi>principles,</hi> hee reads to them the Alphabet of <hi>repentance;</hi> he would firſt teach them to ſpell <hi>repentance:</hi> For <hi>teares,</hi> and <hi>ſighes,</hi> and <hi>groanes,</hi> and <hi>rending</hi> of the heart, and <hi>beating</hi> in peices of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> he knew theſe things were requiſite to <hi>repentance,</hi> but theſe were <hi>harſh</hi> ſymptomes, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds not theſe now, but onely that thy bring <hi>words.</hi> It is not now, take to you <hi>teares,</hi> but <hi>words.</hi> That is the ſecond thing <hi>commendable</hi> in the Prophet; and that ſhall ſerve for the <hi>motive</hi> that induced him to make this <hi>excitement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing, is the <hi>excitement</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>Take to you words,</hi> words of <hi>repentance,</hi> and words of <hi>prayer.</hi> He would inſtruct them in two <hi>languages</hi> at once: For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very grace of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> hath a peculiar <hi>language; Faith</hi> hath its <hi>language,</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> hath her <hi>language, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> hath her <hi>language, Prayer</hi> hath <hi>language</hi> for all the reſt: The Prophet at once would inſtruct them in the <hi>language</hi> of <hi>repentance</hi> and of <hi>prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the language of <hi>repentance,</hi> and that is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of ſin; that is the <hi>tongue</hi> of <hi>repentance: Take to you words</hi> of <hi>turning,</hi> turning words, words that beſeem <hi>converts,</hi> words of <hi>remorſe,</hi> words of <hi>contrition,</hi> words of <hi>humiliation;</hi> take to you words that you may lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your ſins before God: So, hee ſhewes them <hi>two</hi> things concerning the duty of <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin.</p>
                  <p>One is the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the confeſſion of ſin to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>repentance,</hi> no <hi>repentance</hi> without <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin, nor no pardon where there is no <hi>repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other concernes the forme of this <hi>confeſſion,</hi> what manner of <hi>confeſſion</hi> men muſt bring to God: <hi>Take to you theſe words, and turne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:114893:46"/>
                  <p>The firſt is concerning the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the grace; <hi>Take to you words,</hi> confeſſe your ſins to God; that is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it, becauſe the Prophet would draw them into a courſe of <hi>diverſion</hi> of Gods <hi>judgements;</hi> there is no <hi>diverſion</hi> of <hi>judgement</hi> without the pardon of ſin, and there is no pardon without <hi>confeſſion,</hi> therefore hee preſſeth this duty: It is the interpretation that all take in. <hi>Confeſſe</hi> your ſins to God, and ſo turne to him; becauſe without <hi>confeſſion</hi> there is no pardon, no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſets it downe ſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. <hi>Hee that covers his ſins ſhall not proſper;</hi> that is, he that would <hi>hide</hi> them from God; he that will not <hi>open</hi> them by <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> ſhall not proſper, as not in other courſes of his life, ſo <hi>eſpecially,</hi> he ſhall not proſper towards God, and Heaven, towards <hi>ſpirituall comfort;</hi> to have any <hi>comfort</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin; for God hath ſet this <hi>condition,</hi> if we will have him <hi>cover</hi> our ſins, we muſt <hi>open</hi> them; if we will have him <hi>cover</hi> them, we muſt <hi>diſcover</hi> them: if we will have him <hi>ſhut his eyes</hi> on them, wee muſt <hi>open our eyes</hi> upon them, and lay them <hi>open</hi> to God that knows them; there is no <hi>repentance,</hi> and no <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> without <hi>confeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, where there is an humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, and <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin to God, there <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſtill follows: See it in the <hi>Theſis, He that covers his ſins ſhall not proſper,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, but he that confeſſeth, and forſakes them ſhall finde mercy:</hi> So in the <hi>Theſis:</hi> See it in the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> in <hi>David, I ſayd I will confeſſe my ſins, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin, Pſal.</hi> 32. It was not onely ſo in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> but in the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> time, and in <hi>Johns</hi> time, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins:</hi> If we <hi>confeſſe them, he is faithfull and juſt,</hi> he is not only <hi>mercifull,</hi> but <hi>faithfull:</hi> A man would have thought it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114893:47"/>ſhould have run thus, If we <hi>confeſſe</hi> our ſins he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and full of <hi>loving kindneſſe</hi> to forgive them; no, but hee is juſt: Why? Becauſe God hath promiſed <hi>pardon</hi> to the <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin; it is not onely grounded upon his <hi>mercy,</hi> but upon his <hi>truth,</hi> and therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>juſtice:</hi> God were not <hi>juſt</hi> if he ſhould not <hi>pardon</hi> ſin to <hi>Penitents:</hi> If we confeſſe our ſins, he is not onely <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>mercifull,</hi> but <hi>faithfull</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> to forgive ſin: He hath bound himſelfe, that hee that makes a humble confeſſion to God in Chriſt, and comes with a <hi>penitent</hi> heart by Faith in Chriſt, he is <hi>faithfull</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> to forgive ſin. We ſee upon the hiding of our ſinnes, pardon is <hi>excluded,</hi> upon the opening of our ſins, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is <hi>aſſured.</hi> So it ſtands, ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> both wayes, <hi>Cum accuſat excuſat, cum condemnat abſolvit, &amp;c.</hi> When we <hi>accuſe</hi> ourſelves, God <hi>acquits</hi> us, when we <hi>condemne</hi> our ſelves, God <hi>abſolves</hi> us: Here is the ready way to get abſolution, for a man to caſt downe himſelfe. He that takes no glory to himſelfe, but all ſhame, and gives glory to God, God will give grace to ſuch a ſoule; otherwiſe, let us never think that God will <hi>pardon</hi> thoſe that we labour to <hi>hide</hi> from him, <hi>Si faves tu peccato, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſweetly; if thou take upon thee to be the <hi>advocate</hi> of thy ſins, to plead for them, how ſhall God be the <hi>acquitter,</hi> and <hi>abſolver?</hi> Therefore that God may free thee from them, <hi>condemne</hi> thy ſelfe, lay the bond, and obligation and weight of thy ſins upon thine owne conſcience; that is the way to have God to eaſe them, that is the way the Prophet preſcribes.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, we need not be diſcouraged at this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it is not in the wit of man; and it were too bold a word to ſay that God himſelfe could not invent a more eaſie way, we know not how farr God can goe, but we cannot ſee that God could have found a more
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114893:47"/>
                     <hi>facile</hi> way then for men to <hi>confeſſe</hi> and finde <hi>mercy,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and have mercy: The true <hi>confeſſion</hi> of the lips, out of <hi>contrition</hi> of ſpirit by Faith in Chriſt is moſt ſure to meet with pardon and forgiveneſſe. Let any tell me whether there be a more compendious way to remiſſion then this: It is but an <hi>eaſie</hi> way that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the other word, <hi>Turne to the Lord,</hi> and the Lord aſſures the removing of judgements upon that. But <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin is more <hi>eaſie,</hi> it is that that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current with the other, it is that that waites on it; nay, it is that that goes before; and if there be this humble <hi>acknowledgement</hi> made, if it be not out of <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> and hypocriſie, God hath aſſured <hi>pardon</hi> to it: So dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent are the conditions of the Covenant at the firſt, and now; the precept that God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> was harder, Thou ſhalt not <hi>commit</hi> ſin, but the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement he gives us is eaſie, If thou ſin, <hi>confeſſe</hi> thy ſins to God, and he will have mercy: <hi>Confeſſion</hi> is the <hi>ſalve;</hi> as God alone is the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> ſo here he preſcribes by the Prophet the ſalve for ſinne. <hi>Nazienzen</hi> calls it ſo ſweetly: It is the <hi>Potion</hi> that the ſoule takes, it is the <hi>Plaſter</hi> that is to be applyed to the ſore of ſin. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> enlargeth it, by making the proportion in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part: <hi>Sin,</hi> that is the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> and ulcer; and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin, and the renouncing of our ſin, that is the <hi>remedy:</hi> The remedy, ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi> well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the opening of the wound: Saith <hi>Origen,</hi> it is as the <hi>Vomit</hi> that is taken into the ſtomack, that clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſtomack; ſo repentance unloads the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; confeſſion, and caſting out ſin by the mouth, it is the <hi>Vomit</hi> of the ſoule, ſaith he well. Confeſſion it is the phyſick, that healing Medicine that God hath preſcribed to us: <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſumms up many vertues in a ſhort <hi>compendium</hi> of words, ſpeaking of this excellent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114893:48"/>grace of <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin to God. Confeſſion of ſin to God, is that which is the <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>Beleevers,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>ſinners,</hi> the <hi>expeller</hi> of all <hi>vice,</hi> and all iniquity; the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keep a man in compaſſe of due obedience, the ſweet bond to the ſoule; it is that that <hi>ſhuts</hi> the pit of <hi>Hell,</hi> it is that that <hi>opens</hi> the gate of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> becauſe it opens the way to the mercy of God; <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin is the language of repentance.</p>
                  <p>That when I conſider, I cannot but wonder that men that are ſenſible of ſin, and of Gods diſpleaſure, ſhould be ſo backward to this worke, not onely of <hi>repentance,</hi> but of <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of ſin. It is a common fault we all labour of. Firſt, we <hi>commit</hi> a ſinne, and then with <hi>Adam</hi> we <hi>hide</hi> our ſelves, and get Fig-leaves, not onely to hide our ſelves from men, but from God. It is true, I cannot but wonder that men are loath to make their ſins knowne to God; there is impious ſhame that keeps men from confeſſing their ſins to men, becauſe unleſſe we tell them there are corner ſins of darkneſſe that men cannot finde out; but is it ſhame to <hi>confeſſe</hi> them to God? God knowes them all before, why ſhould men goe about to hide that which he <hi>knowes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is committed? Why ſhould I <hi>hide</hi> them from thee, O Lord, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſince thou knoweſt mine owne heart better then I my <hi>ſelfe?</hi> Yet ſo vaine we are, we thinke if no earthly eye ſee us in the commiſſion of ſin, neyther doth the eye of Heaven looke upon us: When we ſee not our <hi>ſelves,</hi> we thinke God ſees us not; we deſire to walke in Miſts and Clouds, it is the caſe of every man: <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſets it downe well, concerning this duty of confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Every may hath forehead enough for the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſinne, their foreheads are harder then an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant to commit ſinne, but then they have no forehead
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114893:48"/>to confeſſe: It is ſhame that keeps them from men, and it is ſhame that keeps them from God. <hi>Et ſic, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith he, no marvell if they periſh with that ill ſhame, and pudor, ſince they are more mindfull of ſhamefaſtneſſe then ſalvation; for if there be any ſhame in confeſſing ſins to God, there is a great deale more in hiding them. But it is ſo farr from ſhame, that it is the onely grace, it is the firſt fruits of repentance, confeſſion. <hi>Children</hi> when they are firſt borne, <hi>cry;</hi> it is the firſt expreſſion of <hi>life, crying;</hi> and hee that is borne and begotten to God againe, that is, a new borne babe, the firſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of life is from the mouth, by confeſſion of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>O Beloved, let us not be ſo inured to hide our ſins from God that muſt onely pardon them, not to hide them from him, that will call us to account: If wee hide them now, the time will be that he will lay them open. Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpell, that <hi>that is done in ſecret ſhall be publiſhed on the houſe top:</hi> that that is now done in <hi>corners</hi> ſhall then be layd open, when all <hi>fleſh</hi> ſhall be layd <hi>open</hi> before Gods <hi>tribunall:</hi> If <hi>now</hi> it be a <hi>little ſhame,</hi> what will it be <hi>then?</hi> If there be <hi>ſhame</hi> in ſin <hi>now,</hi> what <hi>confuſion</hi> will there be when it ſhall be the forerunner of <hi>damnation</hi> and Hell?

                  <p>Theſe three things I will breifly touch.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The neceſſity of <hi>vocall</hi> prayer, <hi>Take to you words.</hi> Thinke it not enough to turne your <hi>hearts</hi> to God: It is true, <hi>importunity</hi> of <hi>affection</hi> moves God more then <hi>importunity</hi> of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> for he looks to the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>reines,</hi> and <hi>requires truth in</hi> the <hi>inward parts:</hi> But though the heart be <hi>principall</hi> in the <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> yet it is not the <hi>ſole</hi> agent. All <hi>prayer</hi> is not included in <hi>conceived</hi> prayer: God will have honour of the <hi>lips,</hi> as well as of the <hi>heart;</hi> he did not make man all <hi>ſoule</hi> and <hi>ſpirit:</hi> as he made him part <hi>body,</hi> and part <hi>ſoule,</hi> ſo he will have honour of <hi>both.</hi> Honour him in the <hi>heart,</hi> that is the cheife, elſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not prevaile, when we <hi>draw neere him with our lips, if our hearts be farr from him:</hi> But the <hi>heart</hi> is not the onely thing, though it be the <hi>cheife;</hi> get <hi>words</hi> to your ſelves, get a good <hi>expreſſion.</hi> For this purpoſe, God hath given man the uſe of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> not onely that he ſhould <hi>converſe</hi> with Men, but wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h God; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeth with men by intercourſe of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> with God by <hi>prayer: Prayer</hi> is the language of the <hi>heart,</hi> God is <hi>delighted</hi> with that; God is delighted with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>prayer,</hi> or elſe hee would not have ſet us ſo many <hi>formes</hi> in Scripture, and all thoſe <hi>dictates.</hi> God could worke <hi>grace</hi> in the <hi>heart</hi> without <hi>Preaching,</hi> but he uſeth <hi>outward</hi> meanes, becauſe men have <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>ſoules,</hi> and God can accept the prayer of the <hi>heart;</hi> but God will have <hi>both</hi> parts. Seek to God with the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> man and with the <hi>outward</hi> man. <hi>David</hi> calls his <hi>tongue</hi> his <hi>glory,</hi> for that end; for the <hi>tongue</hi> is the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>tongue</hi> is the <hi>Secretary</hi> of the <hi>minde,</hi> it is that <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> that every poor <hi>contrite</hi> ſoule ſends to God.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>words</hi> that flye to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and paſſe the <hi>Clouds,</hi> are delivered and dictated by the <hi>tongue:</hi> Therefore it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114893:54"/>is that God hath made ſome part of the <hi>body</hi> the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter</hi> to all the duties of <hi>piety. Mourning</hi> is one part of <hi>repentance;</hi> the <hi>interpreter</hi> of that <hi>affection</hi> of ſorrow, is the <hi>eye;</hi> if the <hi>heart mourne,</hi> the <hi>eye</hi> will weep: <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> and <hi>dejection</hi> of ſpirit, the caſting downe of the ſoule, that is another <hi>grace,</hi> within, and there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>interpreter</hi> without, the <hi>knee</hi> is the interpreter of that grace; if the <hi>heart</hi> be caſt <hi>downe,</hi> the <hi>body</hi> will, the <hi>knee</hi> will bow. <hi>Charity</hi> is another grace of the <hi>heart</hi> within; the <hi>interpreter</hi> without is the <hi>hand;</hi> if the <hi>heart</hi> be <hi>inlarged</hi> to <hi>wiſh</hi> well, the <hi>hand</hi> will be inlarged to <hi>give</hi> to the poore: And if the <hi>heart</hi> be inlarged with <hi>devotion,</hi> the <hi>hands</hi> will ſpread; the <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>eye</hi> move as the <hi>heart</hi> dictates, and the <hi>knees</hi> bow as the <hi>heart</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, every part of the body is the <hi>interpreter</hi> of the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Prayer</hi> it is a grace of the <hi>heart,</hi> but it hath an <hi>interpreter</hi> without, the <hi>tongue</hi> is the interpreter; it is the <hi>Angell</hi> or <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of the <hi>underſtanding. Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> calls it the <hi>Trumpet</hi> of the ſoule: The <hi>tongue,</hi> it is not onely the <hi>interpreter,</hi> but the <hi>ſollicitor:</hi> The tongue is the <hi>ſollicitor</hi> that the <hi>heart</hi> ſends to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> God requires not the prayer of the <hi>lips,</hi> becauſe he cannot heare the prayer of the <hi>heart,</hi> God forbid we ſhould think ſo, <hi>he knowes our thoughts before they are.</hi> A mans <hi>ſilence</hi> is a <hi>cry</hi> to God; he heard <hi>Moſes</hi> when hee ſaid nothing; he heares the <hi>ſilence</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> as well as the <hi>voice. Tertullian</hi> well expreſſeth it, he is not onely the <hi>beholder</hi> of the heart, but the <hi>hearer</hi> of the heart: The <hi>heart</hi> hath its <hi>language,</hi> and every part of the <hi>body</hi> hath its <hi>language;</hi> the <hi>eyes language</hi> is <hi>weeping,</hi> and the <hi>hands</hi> language is lifting up, and the <hi>knees</hi> language, it is <hi>bowing,</hi> and all comes from the language of the <hi>heart:</hi> God underſtands the language of each <hi>part;</hi> if the <hi>heart</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:114893:54"/>ſpeake, though the <hi>tongue</hi> be ſilent, he <hi>underſtands</hi> that. When a man lyes upon his <hi>death-bed,</hi> and his <hi>ſpeech</hi> is gone, the <hi>hands</hi> are <hi>lifted</hi> up, God heares that: A man may <hi>pray</hi> with his <hi>eyes,</hi> with his <hi>hands,</hi> with his <hi>knees,</hi> but he muſt not <hi>confine</hi> his prayer to theſe; he may <hi>pray</hi> with his <hi>heart,</hi> but hee muſt not <hi>confine</hi> prayer to the <hi>heart:</hi> God will not onely have us ſay we pray <hi>within,</hi> we pray to God, and we <hi>wiſh</hi> well, and never conſider that God is <hi>over</hi> our heads, we ſend up <hi>ejaculations;</hi> but <hi>take to you words;</hi> where is the witneſſe of your <hi>mentall</hi> prayer? <hi>Take to you words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The point is this, I will but name it:
<q>Vocall Prayer is a great helpe to the ejaculations of the minde.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath great advantage, in <hi>publike,</hi> and in <hi>private</hi> prayer.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>publike</hi> prayer it is <hi>ſimply neceſſary;</hi> there cannot be a <hi>combination</hi> of <hi>affections,</hi> except there be <hi>vocall</hi> prayer: we cannot read the <hi>language</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> one of another. There cannot be <hi>union</hi> of <hi>affections,</hi> except there be one <hi>voice</hi> for <hi>all:</hi> Nothing commends <hi>prayer</hi> more to God, then <hi>unity,</hi> if it be the prayer of <hi>unity;</hi> the <hi>harmony</hi> of prayer cannot be preſerved in a <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> without <hi>vocall prayer,</hi> except it be expreſſed by <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>formes,</hi> they are neceſſary, that I ſhall ſhew after. There muſt be <hi>vocall</hi> prayer uſed, that the <hi>Congregation</hi> may be joyned together: Therefore we pray in the laſt prayer, <hi>We make our common ſupplications.</hi> I take occaſion, becauſe people take occaſion to <hi>miſtake,</hi> it is not <hi>common,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>ordinary</hi> ſupplications, but thus, <hi>common</hi> ſupplications that concerne us <hi>all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is needfull alſo in <hi>private</hi> prayer, it hath theſe three advantages.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:114893:55"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Prayer of the <hi>tongue,</hi> it makes prayer a <hi>perfect</hi> burnt Sacrifice, when the tongue joynes in words: <hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>dart, zeale points it,</hi> and <hi>words feather it;</hi> when it is <hi>poynted</hi> by <hi>zeale,</hi> and <hi>feathered</hi> by <hi>words,</hi> it flyes home; when the <hi>inward</hi> and the <hi>outward</hi> man agree together, when the <hi>ſtrings</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> and the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>tongue</hi> ſpeake one thing, then there is a <hi>perfect Sacrifice</hi> offered to God. Pray to him with the <hi>heart,</hi> and with the <hi>lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The language of <hi>prayer</hi> is needfull to be expreſt by the <hi>lips;</hi> becauſe words are as <hi>bellows</hi> to the <hi>affections,</hi> they are a meanes to kindle good <hi>affections. Words</hi> reſtraine affections that they ſhall not <hi>rove;</hi> they <hi>confine</hi> the affections to <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> deſires, they not onely <hi>confine,</hi> but as I ſayd, they <hi>kindle</hi> affections. They are as <hi>bellows. Prayer</hi> is as <hi>Incenſe, zeale</hi> puts to the <hi>fire</hi> in prayer, and <hi>words</hi> are the <hi>bellows</hi> that <hi>blow</hi> it up to make it flame; they make this Incenſe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſume</hi> but <hi>flame.</hi> If <hi>words</hi> be wanting, prayer will <hi>coole</hi> of it ſelfe; it is impoſſible that a man ſhould <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> and <hi>perſevere</hi> in prayer, except he uſe <hi>words;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>affections</hi> will <hi>rove:</hi> The <hi>heart</hi> is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe pious <hi>ejaculations;</hi> but to <hi>perſevere</hi> in prayer, without <hi>conſining</hi> to <hi>formed</hi> words, or where there is a <hi>habite</hi> of prayer without <hi>words,</hi> it is impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is the meanes to <hi>glorifie</hi> God more: In prayer we <hi>glorifie</hi> God in <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoule:</hi> It is not enough that we glorifie God <hi>within,</hi> we may doe it <hi>within,</hi> but who knowes it? Then it is onely to our ſelves; but when it is with the <hi>lips,</hi> we doe it to <hi>others:</hi> Even the Saints in <hi>Heaven</hi> uſe <hi>language</hi> in the glorifying of God; they <hi>ſing</hi> to the glory of God, <hi>Halelujah,</hi> that ſong of praiſe to God, and expreſſe it by words, becauſe there
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114893:55"/>may be a <hi>common</hi> participation, that they may make an <hi>eccho:</hi> Therefore <hi>David</hi> though he were a man that had a <hi>mentall</hi> gift of prayer, yet he confined not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to it: <hi>I called to God with my voice, and he heard my prayer; I will ſing of thy kindneſſe for ever, and with my mouth I will declare it:</hi> Marke, I will <hi>ſing</hi> of it, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it with my mouth,</hi> and <hi>call</hi> to God with my <hi>voyce:</hi> Therefore becauſe there is a neceſſity of <hi>Vocall</hi> prayer to <hi>glorifie</hi> God, that is the firſt reaſon the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Take words,</hi> that is the firſt duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ſhewes the neceſſity of <hi>preparation:</hi> It is not onely <hi>uſe</hi> words; the <hi>Heathen that thinke to be heard for much babling,</hi> they <hi>uſe</hi> words, but they <hi>take</hi> not words. What is that? To <hi>ſtudy,</hi> to <hi>ſingle,</hi> and <hi>cull</hi> out <hi>words</hi> before, to caſt <hi>about</hi> where to get words. Looke into the cloſet of your heart, and ſee what things you want; ſee what acceptable formes the Saints uſed, then come, and humble your ſelves before God, but <hi>take</hi> to you words: The neceſſity of <hi>preparation</hi> in the duty of prayer is briefely layd downe by <hi>Solomon,</hi> in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Be not raſh to utter a thing before God, for he is in Heaven.</hi> That is, <hi>Ruſh</hi> not upon prayer, goe not into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence before thou be <hi>fitted,</hi> there muſt be holy <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> not onely before <hi>publike,</hi> but <hi>private</hi> prayer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, we come to pray, and the reaſon why our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are denyed, is, becauſe our hearts rove. He will never come into Gods preſence with <hi>reverence</hi> one day, that prepares not ſomewhat the day before, that ſets not worldly things aſide the day before. As in <hi>publike,</hi> ſo in <hi>private</hi> prayer, <hi>prepare</hi> before you come to Church, and after: How ever ſome would ſcare Chriſtians out of <hi>piety,</hi> they ſhall not ſcare Chriſtians from their <hi>duty.</hi> They ſay, it is ſuperſtition for a man to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before God when hee comes to the Church, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114893:56"/>Congregation: they ſay, hee muſt <hi>joyne</hi> with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, there muſt not be a <hi>ſequeſtration,</hi> though it be never ſo ſhort to fit himſelfe: It is true, a man <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> and <hi>prepares</hi> himſelfe before, but now he comes to the <hi>performance</hi> of it. I humble my ſelfe before, but now I come to the performance, give me <hi>ſuch</hi> a heart as I may <hi>joyne</hi> with thy Servants to <hi>confeſſe</hi> our ſins, and to make knowne our wants: And this muſt be <hi>ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in their interpretation, becauſe we doe not <hi>joyne</hi> with the Congregation: They make no conſcience of it, if they did, they would not keepe their owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture at the <hi>Creed,</hi> they to <hi>ſit,</hi> and others <hi>ſtand:</hi> I will be bold to ſay, it is <hi>fancie.</hi> The hearts of Chriſtians muſt not be troubled, whereby there comes a great deale of offence; they run out of the Church if a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>humble</hi> himſelfe before God in the Pulpit, what they pleaſe muſt be <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi> No, when we come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, there muſt be <hi>preparation. David prayed</hi> before he <hi>prayed, Let the lifting up of my hands be as Incenſe. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> ſtudyed before he prayed, <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and make my ſupplication? What geſture</hi> ſhall I uſe? and what <hi>preparation</hi> ſhall I make? So ſhould every good Chriſtian; and the reaſon is good, prayer is <hi>weighty,</hi> the tongue is <hi>ſlippery,</hi> and the affections <hi>ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> a man had need to <hi>hedge</hi> in his heart with all <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:</hi> If a man ſpeak to <hi>men,</hi> as I come to ſpeak to you, yet I dare not come without due <hi>preparation,</hi> and yet I ſpeak to <hi>men,</hi> as my ſelfe; much more when a man comes before <hi>God.</hi> If a man when he ſpeaks to <hi>men,</hi> labours to ſhun <hi>Shelves</hi> and <hi>Soliciſmes</hi> of ſpeech, and to ingratiate his perſon, and <hi>preſſe</hi> it home upon the hearts of his hearers, how much more when he ſpeaks before God, that reads the language of the <hi>heart,</hi> who is a God <hi>that heares prayer,</hi> to whoſe preſence <hi>all fleſh comes. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:114893:56"/>when he was to ſpeak to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> durſt not goe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanted words, and was a <hi>man of flow ſpeech,</hi> and ſo <hi>Jeremie;</hi> yet they were but to ſpeake to men. If any man ſay there was a neceſſitie, becauſe they went on <hi>Gods</hi> errand; that was not the reaſon, looke back to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane oratours, <hi>Demoſthenes, Tullie,</hi> ſee what preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they made to ſpeak before <hi>humane</hi> auditorie; yet they would correct their <hi>errours,</hi> and ſet every word in <hi>due</hi> place; they would get words, <hi>pick</hi> up phraſes, if any <hi>tittle</hi> of pronunciation were more advangious then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they would get that, meerely to prevaile in <hi>civill</hi> cauſes for <hi>men;</hi> how much more when we come to <hi>God</hi> in prayer, and not only be <hi>orators,</hi> but <hi>petitioners,</hi> and for the <hi>beſt</hi> of his mercies, for <hi>grace,</hi> the <hi>richeſt</hi> jewell in all his Store-houſe; and God that ſearcheth the <hi>heart,</hi> and ſees if the heart and Spirit be anſwerable to the tongue, and hand; a man had need to be prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand: Therefore <hi>Abraham,</hi> a man that had hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly acquaintance with God, he fitted himſelfe before he would come in prayer; ſee how many prefaces he uſeth, <hi>ſix</hi> times he prayes, and every prayer hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <hi>Let not my Lord be angrie, and I will ſpeake. Behold I have taken upon me to ſpeake, that am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> He uſeth thoſe holie prefaces to <hi>ingratiate</hi> himſelfe with God: knowing how great an honour it is, for God to vouchſafe a <hi>mortall</hi> creature to ſpeake to him: ſo will we, if we conſider the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of Gods <hi>majeſtie,</hi> we will <hi>pray,</hi> that we may <hi>pray, ſearch,</hi> and examine, and ſee what <hi>bleſſings</hi> God hath <hi>beſtowed,</hi> and then we ſhall know what to give <hi>thankes</hi> for, ſee what <hi>evill</hi> we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and then wee ſhall know what to <hi>mourne</hi> for; ſee what <hi>judgements</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> God hath <hi>removed,</hi> and then wee ſhall know how to <hi>bleſſe</hi> him, what ſinnes we are prone to, that wee may know what to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114893:57"/>and ſee what temporall things wee need, and then we may know what to <hi>beg;</hi> this the Prophet would have, <hi>Take words, ſtudie</hi> words before you come, take not <hi>perfunctorie</hi> words, uſe not ſuch as come firſt to hand; deale not ſo <hi>boldly,</hi> and <hi>familiarly</hi> with the glorious preſence of God: ſpeake to God as if you did ſpeake to <hi>men,</hi> nay as if you were to ſpeake before the <hi>judge</hi> of all men.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, here he gives a direction what words to uſe in prayer. The language of prayer is of a great extent: looke how many our wants are, ſo many ſeverall <hi>formes</hi> and dialects our prayer hath; and looke how various mens <hi>hearts</hi> are, ſo various is <hi>prayer,</hi> but for our directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confine it to theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Take to you words,</hi> that is, <hi>holie,</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> words, ſuch as becomes that glorious Majeſtie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our bleſſed Saviour hath taught us to pray to <hi>Our Father in Heaven,</hi> intimating that when we come to God, we muſt not only bring heavenly <hi>affections,</hi> but heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>word:</hi> what are thoſe? words that reliſh of <hi>heaven;</hi> words that have the coyne and ſtamp of the Spirit of God on them, he that brings a <hi>earthly</hi> heart and <hi>carnall,</hi> earthly words to God, cannot ſpeed: Prayer hath a dialect proper to it ſelfe: bring <hi>words;</hi> that is, <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> words.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, bring with you words; that is, <hi>forcible, fervent, powerfull</hi> words; (come not to God with a <hi>cold</hi> temper) they are ſuch words that muſt prevaile: for there is a language that ſpecially prevailes with God; that is, bring ſuch words as may importune God. It is not a cold <hi>muttering</hi> of a <hi>forme</hi> of prayer that is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God; no, but pray with the <hi>heart,</hi> not only <hi>ſpeake</hi> but <hi>call,</hi> nor <hi>call</hi> but <hi>crie, ask,</hi> and <hi>ſeeke,</hi> and <hi>knock;</hi> if <hi>asking</hi> will not ſerve, <hi>ſeeke,</hi> if that will not doe, <hi>knock.</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:114893:57"/>There is a delight in God, to be not only ſpoken to, but <hi>forced, the violent take heaven,</hi> and there is no violence, but of <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>prayer; faith</hi> by one <hi>violence,</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> by <hi>another.</hi> The prayer of the fervent heart breakes through the Clouds; no impediment can keep it from Gods throne, take <hi>fervent</hi> words, <hi>wooe</hi> God, <hi>intreate</hi> him, <hi>importune</hi> him, to ſee if he will be intreated to turne from his wrath.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take <hi>intelligent</hi> words, underſtand your ſelves what you ſpeake, uſe not ſuch words as doe not expreſſe your mind. It is a mocking of God to come to God in an unknowne language. That is the great deluſion of our adverſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> the great manner of <hi>cogging</hi> to delude the people, to keepe them in <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> from knowing the word of God, and what they ſpeake to God; that as they <hi>believe</hi> by an <hi>implicite</hi> faith, ſo they muſt <hi>pray</hi> by an <hi>implicite</hi> devotion, that if the Prieſt that ſets them the forme of prayer, or if the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould goe about to deceive them (as they doe too too much, they might ſet a forme of <hi>curſing</hi> as well as <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and how can they underſtand it? and they muſt take it upon truſt. Theſe are not intelligible words, but I cannot proceed further.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was well ſayd by Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that <hi>Art</hi> perfects <hi>nature,</hi> hee found the proofe thereof in himſelfe; for it had perfected him: For <hi>minerals</hi> and <hi>vegetatives,</hi> you all know, that it is <hi>mechanick,</hi> and <hi>inferiour</hi> Arts that <hi>perfect</hi> them. <hi>Nature</hi> gives <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>Art purifies</hi> it; nature gives <hi>Stones</hi> that are precious, and Art makes them more <hi>precious; nature</hi> gives <hi>ſimples,</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> makes them <hi>confections.</hi> And for <hi>man</hi> that is the moſt excellent of <hi>inferiour</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they are the <hi>ingenious</hi> and the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Arts that <hi>perfect</hi> man.

It <hi>converts the ſoule,</hi> it <hi>rejoyceth the heart,</hi> it delights the <hi>eye,</hi> for our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> it teacheth us to live, for our <hi>thoughts,</hi> it teacheth us to, <hi>meditate</hi> for our <hi>ſpeech,</hi> it teacheth to diſcourſe godly. If there were no more Scriptures, yet this one Text that I have read, ſhewes the proofe of it.</p>
                  <p>Its the Prophets intendment by this Scripture to worke a <hi>change</hi> in the people of the Jewes to whom he preached, to worke an <hi>alteration,</hi> to a better knowing of this by experience, that the word it <hi>corrects,</hi> and <hi>reformes,</hi> and there is in every part of it, a ſeverall reformation, that may be wrought, if the heart be hardened, here this Scripture teacheth to <hi>humble</hi> them, <hi>Turne to the Lord,</hi> if the armes be infolded, this Scripture teacheth to <hi>ſpread</hi> them, if the <hi>lips</hi> be <hi>ſowed</hi> up, if the <hi>tongue ſtammer,</hi> that we know not how to expreſſe our ſelves before the heavenly majeſtie, this Scripture teacheth to open them, <hi>Take with you words, &amp;c.</hi> So, that which was intended
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114893:59"/>by him when he ſpake them firſt, is the ſame that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend when I handle them now.</p>
                  <p>The parts you know are two.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>A rule of <hi>excitement,</hi> and</item>
                     <item>A rule of <hi>direction.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The rule of <hi>excitement</hi> to <hi>two</hi> duties, one to the dutie of <hi>action, Turne to the Lord,</hi> of that I ſpake.</p>
                  <q>Another to the dutie of <hi>elocution,</hi> and that is twofold.</q>
                  <p>There is an <hi>excitement</hi> to a <hi>generall</hi> dutie of <hi>prayer.</hi> The <hi>manner</hi> of prayer, <hi>Take with you words,</hi> and go to God. What words I ſhewed the laſt time, the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> &amp; of <hi>confeſſion,</hi> thoſe are the words; and what were the kinds of both, and the <hi>neceſſitie</hi> of both, ſo far I went.</p>
                  <p>Another is this particular forme, <hi>Take words and ſay to him.</hi> This part I am to goe on with.</p>
                  <q>And ſay to him.</q>
                  <p>That is, and ſay <hi>thus</hi> unto him, <hi>in hunc modum, in haec verba,</hi> after this manner in theſe words. The Prophets intendment is to give them a help for their <hi>infirmities</hi> in the worke of <hi>prayer,</hi> he pens a <hi>forme</hi> for them, he ſets this as an <hi>example,</hi> and <hi>patterne</hi> of prayer, whereby they ſhould make their prayers; a forme to uſe when they came before God.</p>
                  <p>He prevents an objection, <hi>Take with you words, and turne to the Lord.</hi> I, faine wee would take words, but <hi>where</hi> ſhall we get them? what words are <hi>fit?</hi> wee are <hi>ignorant,</hi> we are not acquainted with the <hi>language,</hi> that dutie hath been a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to us; who will teach us and inſtruct us, <hi>Wherewith ſhall wee come before the Lord?</hi> what words ſhall we uſe when we come before him?
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114893:60"/>He prevents the objection in theſe words, <hi>And ſay to him;</hi> I will lend you words, if ye be <hi>ignorant</hi> I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you; theſe are the words you ſhall uſe. Like a good inſtructer, he not only teacheth them the <hi>dutie,</hi> that they are to doe, but ſhewes them the <hi>manner</hi> of the performance; he excites them to <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and ſhews to them a patterne of <hi>prayer,</hi> he gives them this forme of <hi>confeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee beloved, that formes of prayer are not <hi>now</hi> taken up only: it is not a thing ſo <hi>new,</hi> as that ſo many diſgraces ſhould be put upon ſet formes, eſpecially thoſe that concerne the whole <hi>people,</hi> a <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> they are as ancient as <hi>Pauls</hi> time. <hi>Paul</hi> is pleaſed to tie himſelfe to a <hi>forme;</hi> and not only when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched (I doe not ſay he did ſo alway, for then there was a greater neceſſitie) but even when he wrote. A man when he writes, hath libertie of time for <hi>varietie,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Paul</hi> having the gifts of the Spirit, yet he ties him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a ſet prayer in al his Epiſtles, and makes it a token whereby it may be known, <hi>Thus I write, the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo he ſhuts up all.</p>
                  <p>Not only <hi>Paul,</hi> but our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> he that is the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> he by whoſe <hi>Spirit</hi> we learne to <hi>pray;</hi> he that commenceth our <hi>ſuits</hi> to God; he that hath the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of all <hi>knowledge,</hi> therefore all <hi>varietie</hi> of heavenly expreſſions; when he prayed before God, and in his <hi>laſt</hi> prayer that he made in the garden; <hi>thrice</hi> he prayd, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and all thoſe times he uſeth the ſame forme, he ſpeakes the ſame words; he went, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt, <hi>Father if it be poſſible:</hi> and then in verſ. 22. he prayes againe and ſaith the <hi>ſame</hi> words: and then in verſe 24. he prayes and ſaith the <hi>ſame</hi> words, he could have had <hi>varietie</hi> to have expreſt that notion, that is, to beg <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of his father which he needed then as <hi>man;</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:114893:60"/>he expreſt it in that <hi>forme:</hi> we have his example, it is as <hi>old</hi> as <hi>Chriſts</hi> time.</p>
                  <p>Nay, before Chriſt came, in the time of the Prophets, it is as old as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that is as farre as we can goe. For <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time it is plaine, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. he cals to the Prieſts to ſing to the Lord in the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Aſaph:</hi> there are many particulars.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they are much to <hi>blame,</hi> that will bring an <hi>ill</hi> report on a good thing, that goe about to ſtumble the conſciences of the <hi>weake,</hi> as though it were an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment</hi> for the Church of God in <hi>publick</hi> to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a ſet <hi>forme.</hi> They might remember that there be examples, and <hi>What was written aforetime, is written for our learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we have more then examples; we have Chriſts direction, <hi>When ye pray, pray thus, Our Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, we reade of the happie <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> that thoſe <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> had; and God approved of the ſame, when they uſed and kept themſelves to formes; he that approved it in <hi>other</hi> Saints, will not diſdaine it in us; if it were <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> in them, it cannot be ill in us.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe <hi>flouts</hi> that they give it, that it is a <hi>ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> a confining of the grace of God: that it is to keepe people to walke upon <hi>crutches;</hi> and making people ſwim upon <hi>bladders;</hi> they are <hi>emptie, vaine, windy</hi> words, that become ſuch <hi>emptie</hi> Spirits: they are not the words of the Spirit of God; they are not words that ſavour of <hi>pietie,</hi> nay not of reaſon.</p>
                  <p>For yet, if they be ſcandalized at the <hi>formes</hi> that <hi>wee</hi> make, will they at the formes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?</hi> will they ſay that Chriſt that conformed to a <hi>forme,</hi> and to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> that it was a walking upon crutches, and a ſwimming with bladders; if they lay ſuch imputations upon the <hi>formes</hi> that we have, they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114893:61"/>will not ſpare to lay the ſame upon that of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they quarrell as much againſt it, as at <hi>our</hi> prayers, that now <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> it muſt be, or I know not what vaine <hi>tauta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> to have the uſe of the <hi>Lords prayer</hi> in publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Why did Chriſt give it? It is the form that he would have his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> uſe to the worlds end; and as one ſaith well, for a man to pray otherwiſe then Chriſt would have him to pray, it is to be imputed <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>ſinne.</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour had a ſpeciall intendment of pietie, when he ſet that forme to his Diſciples, and to the Church of God; and if therefore they finde fault with that, we may well think they will be too ſcrupulous to finde fault with thoſe <hi>formes</hi> that the Church hath ſet.</p>
                  <p>But let them not ſay, that <hi>preparation</hi> to prayer is a <hi>ſtinting</hi> of the Spirit: no, it is not a ſtinting of the Spirit of <hi>God;</hi> but a <hi>reſtraining</hi> of our <hi>owne</hi> wandring Spirits: <hi>Preparation</hi> is not ſo much a confining of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as want of <hi>preparation</hi> is an <hi>abandoning</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>It is true, it is acknowledged, and cannot be denyed, that <hi>conceived</hi> prayer, is an <hi>admirable</hi> grace, where it pleaſeth God to give the <hi>facultie,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> but yet for <hi>publique</hi> prayer, though the gift were had by one, it is not by all.</p>
                  <p>There are ſpeciall <hi>uſes,</hi> and <hi>reaſons,</hi> that in publicke prayers <hi>formes</hi> are to be had.</p>
                  <p>They are ſpeciall <hi>helpes</hi> to the weakneſſe of thoſe that are not able to ſend up their owne ſuits. They are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall helpes of devotion, where the people know not what thoſe things are, that they are to beg of God. They are a ſpeciall meanes, to keepe in the heart, and affections within good <hi>compaſſe,</hi> and <hi>bounds,</hi> to hedg it in that it rove not. They are ſpeciall helpes to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:114893:61"/>and <hi>unanimitie</hi> of prayer. That which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends publique prayer is <hi>one heart,</hi> and <hi>voyce,</hi> ſent to God; how can that be, by ſo many perſons as meet in this congregation, if they have not one <hi>forme?</hi> if there be not <hi>uniformitie</hi> kept in that?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> people doe not ſo much excell in this gift, as fitly to expreſſe themſelves in <hi>conceived</hi> prayer, and oft thoſe that are great ones are wanting, <hi>Wee know not how to pray as we ought.</hi> The Poet ſayd, if men follow their <hi>owne</hi> deſires, they ſeduce them: for what prayers make they?</p>
                  <p>One Poet tels us that they would beg of God that they might have opportunitie to <hi>deceive;</hi> give me grace that I may be <hi>accounted</hi> a holie, and <hi>righteous</hi> man: we may make ſuch prayers as theſe, ſometimes <hi>unlawfull,</hi> ſometimes <hi>hurtfull,</hi> ſometimes <hi>ſinfull</hi> things we ſhould pray for; and ſo more ſinfull we ſhould be, if we utter before God without due <hi>meditation,</hi> what we thought on before. Therfore theſe formes are put to us, we have mention upon record of the prayers of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, Daniel, Habakkuk, Nehemiah, Ezra,</hi> all theirs with many others are ſet downe upon record. To what purpoſe? but that we might thereby learne to fit our ſelves with words to attaine a habit of prayer, by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying of theſe formes.</p>
                  <p>And it is a great incouragement to know the <hi>formes</hi> that the Saints prevailed with of old; that God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch prayers at their hand: he that accepted them <hi>then,</hi> if we ſend them by the ſame Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it will accept them <hi>now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in the courſe of Scripture, for all Chriſtian duties, for all duties of pietie there were formes ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114893:62"/>is a forme ſoe that <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. they were to bleſſe them thus, ſaying <hi>The Lord bleſſe you.</hi> When the Arke <hi>removed</hi> there was a forme for that, the forme then was, <hi>Ariſe O Lord in thy reſting place, among the many thouſands of Iſrael.</hi> When the Arke ſtood ſtill, <hi>Returne O Lord to the many thouſands of Iſrael.</hi> For the worke of <hi>purification,</hi> when any place was to be <hi>cleanſed</hi> from the guilt of <hi>blood,</hi> that lay at the doore of the Citie, thus they were to ſay, <hi>Lord be mercifull to thy people, and lay not guiltines of blood to</hi> us. In the time of <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>humiliation;</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet then ſets a forme for them, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Lords remembrancers ſtand betweene the porch, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and ſay, ſpare thy people O Lord.</hi> And here <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſeeing the neceſſitie in regard of the great defects, and many wants of the people, he cals on them to call upon God: and that their prayer might be accepted, as one that miniſtred to their <hi>infirmities,</hi> and helped their <hi>neceſſities,</hi> therefore he gives them this <hi>forme:</hi> he gave it to <hi>them,</hi> and the Spirit of God commends it to us, by leaving it in Scripture as an example for us to make our prayers by: as a warrant upon occaſion, eſpecially in <hi>publick,</hi> to uſe ſuch a <hi>forme, Take to you</hi> theſe <hi>words,</hi> that I preſcribe, and ſay thus to him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphraſe ſo deſcants upon it, and ſome other <hi>Rabbies;</hi> uſe either theſe, or the like words as theſe, <hi>Take away all iniquitie, and receive us graciouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, I have done with the <hi>preparative,</hi> that is, the rule of <hi>exhortation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Secondly, the rule of direction, and that hath two parts.</p>
                  <p>One is <hi>precatorie,</hi> take away all ſinne.</p>
                  <p>The other part is <hi>promiſſorie, So will we render the calves of our lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:114893:62"/>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe, that is, the part <hi>precatorie,</hi> and therein are two things.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>parts</hi> of which the prayer conſiſts.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>order</hi> of the parts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>parts</hi> of which the prayer conſiſts are two.</p>
                  <p>One is, Take away all <hi>ill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is,</p>
                  <p>Shew us <hi>good, receiveus graciouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt part is for the taking away of all <hi>ill,</hi> and the worſt ill, the <hi>ill</hi> of <hi>ſinne.</hi> It is but <hi>ſhort,</hi> but it is very <hi>pithie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three words in it, and they all have their emphaſis; it is not called <hi>ſinn,</hi> but <hi>iniquitie;</hi> it is not <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> ſinne but <hi>all:</hi> it is not only, lay it <hi>aſide</hi> for a <hi>time,</hi> but take it <hi>away, remove it.</hi> So, theſe three make three parts.</p>
                  <p>There is firſt the thing <hi>deprecated,</hi> and prayed againſt, that is, <hi>iniquitie,</hi> and <hi>ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>extent</hi> of it, how farre the deprecation reacheth, not to a <hi>few,</hi> not to <hi>ſome,</hi> but <hi>all,</hi> take all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie away, and leave <hi>none</hi> behind.</p>
                  <p>Then thirdly, the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>removing</hi> of it, a word that is very full, <hi>Take it away.</hi> We ſhall ſee the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that when we come to it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the thing deprecated, <hi>ſinne.</hi> The Prophet labours hereby, by ſetting this <hi>forme,</hi> to draw them to the <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of their <hi>ſinne;</hi> and not only to an <hi>acknowledgement,</hi> but to an <hi>aggravation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To an <hi>acknowledgement,</hi> in that he wiſheth them to pray thus, <hi>Take away iniquitie.</hi> Saith <hi>Tertullian</hi> well, there is in all <hi>Petitions</hi> of <hi>mercie,</hi> a ſecret <hi>confeſſion</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> he that begs <hi>pardon,</hi> acknowledgeth <hi>ſinne.</hi> He would not only draw them to an <hi>acknowledgement,</hi> but to an <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation:</hi> Therefore he uſeth not the common word,

There are none of us all but acknowledge our ſelves <hi>ſinners,</hi> and we doe not think much to be ſo called: but men will <hi>bluſh,</hi> and be <hi>aſhamed,</hi> and loath to be accounted thoſe that are <hi>impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> that have <hi>iniquitie. Auſtin</hi> ſhewes by it, that there is more in <hi>iniquitie,</hi> then in <hi>ſin:</hi> therefore the Prophet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that phraſe, to teach us what is the <hi>greateſt ill,</hi> againſt which we are to bend all our prayers, what was the great evill againſt which they were to millitate with their prayers? <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>iniquitie.</hi> All a Chriſtians <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> all his <hi>examinations,</hi> all his <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> are to looke this way, to the taking away of <hi>iniquitie.</hi> It is the moſt <hi>frequent</hi> Prayer that we are to put up; it is that daylie prayer, that wee are to put up; what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we doe, and what ever wee ſtand in need of: there is no <hi>bleſſing</hi> that we are to beg of God, but this muſt goe in, aſke in the firſt place <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>ſinne.</hi> If a man be to ſit downe at his Table to eate meate, firſt beg <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne, becauſe ſinne will be a meanes to curſe it to him; it cannot be good without Gods bleſſing; <hi>ſinne</hi> may hinder the <hi>naturall</hi> worke of the creature; if a man be to goe a <hi>journey,</hi> and beg Gods <hi>protection,</hi> let him firſt aſke <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne; for that will expoſe him to <hi>danger:</hi> there is no keeping of <hi>ſinne</hi> in the <hi>houſe,</hi> and in the <hi>heart,</hi> firſt beg for the <hi>removing</hi> of that. If a man goe about his <hi>worke,</hi> he begs Gods bleſſing upon his labour, but firſt let him aſke <hi>reconciliation</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne: for ſinne will make a mans labour <hi>unfruitfull,</hi> and <hi>unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> and bring a <hi>curſe</hi> upon his labour. If a man come to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to heare the word of <hi>God,</hi> and to joyne in <hi>prayer</hi> with the people of God, O let him, though he meane to aske a bleſſing, that it may ediſie,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114893:63"/>yet let him firſt beg pardon; for ſinne ſtops the <hi>eares</hi> of a man in <hi>hearing,</hi> and ſtops the <hi>eares</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>hearing.</hi> When God ſpeakes to us, if <hi>ſinne</hi> be not <hi>purged</hi> out of our hearts, we ſhall not benefit by the <hi>word,</hi> and we ſhal have no benefit by our <hi>prayers, If I regard iniquitie in my heart, the Lord will not heare my prayer.</hi> Therefore, this is the reaſon the Prophet would have them bend the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their indeavours, and <hi>prayers</hi> againſt <hi>ſinne.</hi> It is not, take away our puniſhment, or take away thy <hi>plague,</hi> they were in miſerie now, the Prophet teacheth them, not ſo much to pray for that in generall, but that that they ſhould ſtand upon is, <hi>Take away iniquitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that is the reaſon, why, of all other prayers, the Devill moſt oppoſeth a man, both in making of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and in the comfort by it. He contradicts this prayer eſpecially, becauſe it is a choice fruit of Gods Spirit: and it is that prayer that ruins his Kingdome; reconciliation puls it downe, therefore he oppoſeth that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>One</hi> way whereby he oppoſeth it, is, by keeping men from ſeeing their ſinnes. He that <hi>ſees</hi> not his ſinnes begs not <hi>pardon:</hi> if we be <hi>blind,</hi> we ſhall be <hi>dumb</hi> in that ſence.</p>
                  <p>If he cannot hinder from the <hi>ſight,</hi> he will hinder from the <hi>ſence;</hi> a man will never aſke pardon of that that he <hi>feeles</hi> not <hi>burthenſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he prevaile not with that, then he will keep them from the <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>pardon,</hi> and make them believe that their ſins are unpardonable, what ſhould I beg for <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinnes, my <hi>time</hi> is <hi>paſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If not that, then he labours to keepe them from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the <hi>comfort</hi> of <hi>pardon,</hi> he labours to blind their eyes if they have <hi>pardon,</hi> that they may not ſee that <hi>comfort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:114893:64"/>
                  <p>If not that, he tempts them to <hi>preſumption,</hi> if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder them of the comfort, he labours to draw them to a <hi>preſumptuous</hi> opinion of their <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> that they have <hi>no</hi> ſinne to beg pardon, you are not ſuch a ſinner, &amp;c. It were well, if there were no <hi>ſinne</hi> but is that a <hi>Cockatrice egg,</hi> that they ſhould thinke they need not to aſke pardon of ſinne at the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nds of God.</p>
                  <p>It was one of the opinions in the <hi>primitive</hi> times, but this time farre outſtrips that, becauſe worſe opinions attend upon it: there were ſome that were gotten in <hi>unawares,</hi> I wonder whence this opinion ſhould grow, that Chriſtians ſhould ever come to this height of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, to thinke it <hi>unlawfull</hi> to beg <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes from another, becauſe <hi>God ſees</hi> no ſinne in his Children. But whence comes this, here is an ill <hi>bird,</hi> and an ill <hi>egge,</hi> yet it hath a <hi>dam</hi> that is older ſtill, that is as <hi>damnable</hi> as either, that is, that Chriſtians are not tyed to any obedience of the <hi>morall</hi> law, becauſe they are brought under the <hi>obedience</hi> of Chriſt: ſee how they hang like <hi>Samſons foxes,</hi> that were tyed after a <hi>diſorderly</hi> manner. Firſt the Devill poſſeſſeth their hearts, that there is no <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>law</hi> of God, and thereby he ſtops up the <hi>fountain</hi> of al <hi>pietie.</hi> If there be no obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> it muſt needs follow that there can be no <hi>ſin,</hi> for there is <hi>no ſinne without the tranſgreſſion of the law,</hi> and then there no ſinne for God to ſee, and then they need not after they are in the ſtate of <hi>juſtification,</hi> beg <hi>remiſſion</hi> they need not uſe this prayer, <hi>Take away iniquitie,</hi> nor that of Chriſt, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is not any of all theſe opinions, but they are as I conceive ſprung from the <hi>miſunderſtanding</hi> of ſome <hi>orthodox</hi> point in divinitie, that people not well underſtanding themſelves, doe wreſt.</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:114893:64"/>
                  <p>As the poynt of <hi>juſtification</hi> only by <hi>faith,</hi> that point is only for our <hi>comfort:</hi> we muſt exclude <hi>works</hi> in <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> our <hi>works</hi> have no part in the <hi>juſtification</hi> of a <hi>ſinner;</hi> but it doth not follow, becauſe <hi>faith</hi> only <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> that thereupon they conclude; what have we to do with <hi>works,</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> of the <hi>law?</hi> That is a miſtake; for God, though he <hi>juſtifie</hi> us without <hi>works,</hi> he requires <hi>obedience</hi> as a <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>juſtification,</hi> and as a ſpeciall pledge of that grace that he works in the heart. There is the miſtake of that.</p>
                  <p>The other, and a ſecond branch comes from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of another point that is comfortable, and hath its foundation in the book of God, that he that is <hi>truly</hi> in the ſtate of <hi>ſon-ſhip</hi> cannot fall <hi>finally;</hi> that is a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall point, and of great conſequence: and that is cleare, becauſe elſe Gods <hi>promiſe</hi> ſhould not be <hi>true,</hi> if God were mutable, and ſhould bring us into a ſtate of <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption</hi> one day, and after caſt us out. This is a point of great <hi>prety:</hi> But from wreſting of this comes the other point, that becauſe they cannot fall <hi>totally,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot <hi>fall</hi> at all; that becauſe a man cannot ſinne <hi>finally,</hi> that <hi>juſtification</hi> makes him <hi>totally</hi> gracious that he cannot <hi>ſinne.</hi> For though God keep them from <hi>finall</hi> ſinning, yet the beſt Saints fall. <hi>In many things wee ſinne all:</hi> And <hi>he that ſaith he is not a ſinner, is a lyar,</hi> even of thoſe that are converted. Wee tread <hi>awry every day,</hi> and there are many <hi>ſlips,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>foule,</hi> groſſe <hi>falls;</hi> but it pleaſeth God to raiſe us againe, but it is by <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt, the ſame way that we roſe at the firſt.</p>
                  <p>So, for the third point, that men need not beg <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> it is from a corrupt originall. It is a good heavenly point, that there is a <hi>certainty</hi> of ſalvation granted to many Saints; that <hi>certainty</hi> may be <hi>had,</hi> though it be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114893:65"/>not had by <hi>all,</hi> every one comes not to the ſame <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>aſſurance.</hi> From the miſtake of this, comes the third; becauſe we may be <hi>aſſured</hi> that we are in a ſtate of <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and that ſinne is <hi>pardoned,</hi> we need not beg <hi>pardon:</hi> So, they run to popery another way. <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is a thing that they diſclaim, and while they would run from <hi>popery,</hi> they fall into another extream, and run to <hi>popery</hi> another way. Compare them a little; A Saint may come to <hi>perfection,</hi> and keep all the <hi>morall</hi> law, ſay the Papiſts; a Chriſtian may come to that <hi>perfection,</hi> that he need <hi>not</hi> keep it ſay they. Some ſins are of ſo eaſie a <hi>weight,</hi> they are not to be accounted, God accounts them <hi>no</hi> ſins, the <hi>firſt motions.</hi> God <hi>ſees</hi> not theſe in his Children as ſins ſay the Papiſts. God ſees <hi>no</hi> ſin in his children ſay they: here is their errour. Say the Papiſts, if <hi>aſſurance</hi> may be had, why doe we beg for <hi>forgiveneſſe?</hi> It is fond to beg <hi>pardon,</hi> if wee have <hi>aſſurance:</hi> So they, becauſe the child of God hath <hi>aſſurance,</hi> he needs not beg <hi>pardon.</hi> Thus they run by eſchewing the contrary, into the ſame errour, in a worſe manner then they. For of all other, theſe are moſt <hi>damnable.</hi> There is never an opinion that the Devill hath ſtirred up, that hath a worſe <hi>ſavour</hi> and <hi>intendment</hi> in it then theſe. It over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the foundation of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>piety.</hi> It takes away <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and take him away, take away <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and all at one blow.</p>
                  <p>O, when there are ſuch <hi>fundamentall</hi> errours as theſe, ſhall we wonder if God ſend the <hi>plague</hi> to <hi>purge</hi> his <hi>floore,</hi> when theſe ſhall ſtart up, and are not ſmothered? And thoſe that ſhould ſmother them doe not awake autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. No man cares which way Religion goes, and how it thrives: God will <hi>purge</hi> this <hi>leaven,</hi> from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of theſe opinions, and thoſe that ſhould ſuppreſſe it. God will not have every man preach what he <hi>will,</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:114893:65"/>and hold, and do what he <hi>will.</hi> And if <hi>humane</hi> Lawes be offended, there is ſeverity enough in correcting; Gods law is broken daily, and no man looks after it. Of all others, that one <hi>groſſe</hi> point that Chriſtians are come to, think it <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> nay <hi>needleſſe,</hi> nay <hi>ſinfull,</hi> to beg <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> of ſins; then farewell <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and all.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had ſome in his time that were of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, therefore he hath diverſe paſſages againſt it. They had <hi>no ſinne.</hi> The <hi>forme</hi> that Chriſt gave, it agrees to <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> Chriſtian, it is a forme that all Chriſtians muſt uſe to the worlds <hi>end;</hi> they muſt ſtill pray, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes</hi> as long as they <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>breath.</hi> Not only all other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the maſters of the Flock, thoſe that were the <hi>bell-weathers,</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> ſort of ſheep, that Chriſt committed the <hi>ſheep</hi> to; yet the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> when they were on the croſſe, in ſuffering, or under the axe, yet ſtill they muſt pray, <hi>forgive us our ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in another place ſaith he, There <hi>was</hi> never any <hi>Saint</hi> in the world, or <hi>ſhall</hi> be, but muſt make this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes:</hi> Only that <hi>Sanctum-ſanctorum,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, he is excepted: he gave the <hi>forme,</hi> he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it not.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, and that is a ſweet ſpeech, the whole <hi>Church</hi> of God ſaith it, and he is a <hi>reprobate</hi> that ſaith it not, that he is in that <hi>condition,</hi> of all other there is no greater <hi>ſigne</hi> then this, it is to be <hi>feared</hi> he is in a ſtate of <hi>reprobation</hi> that will not ſay, <hi>Lord forgive us our treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, pardon</hi> our ſins: Therefore there was good reaſon why the Prophet made them make their prayer againſt this <hi>iniquity,</hi> that is the <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> of the <hi>law,</hi> iniquity that makes <hi>ſhipwrack</hi> of <hi>conſcience,</hi> and expoſeth to <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>deprives</hi> of all <hi>comfort,</hi> and iniquity that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth</hi> to <hi>hell;</hi> therefore there they muſt ſettle this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114893:66"/>firſt petition, <hi>Take away iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The extent, <hi>All</hi> iniquity; there is ſome reaſon why he addes that. <hi>All</hi> is a word of <hi>univerſality,</hi> an <hi>indefinite</hi> word; here is no iniquity mentioned, no fin mentioned, but <hi>all</hi> wound up in a clew, all in a lump propounded. <hi>Take away all.</hi> It is not take away <hi>our</hi> i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity, that is meant: It is not take away <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that;</hi> pardon our <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or our <hi>rebellion,</hi> pardon our <hi>propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> or the <hi>adulterers</hi> that <hi>neigh after their neighbours wives:</hi> there be <hi>drunkards</hi> of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> pardon theſe ſins; no, pardon <hi>all.</hi> There is ſome reaſon why the Prophet would have it thus; pardon <hi>all, take away all:</hi> I conceive theſe three reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he would draw them to a <hi>generall</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne; for however we are tyed to a <hi>particular</hi> mention, and confeſſion of thoſe ſins that our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are privy to, upon due <hi>ſearch,</hi> and in our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and humiliation to name them to God. <hi>This</hi> I have done, and <hi>this thou haſt</hi> done, <hi>deliver me from blood-guiltineſſe O God.</hi> So, for thoſe ſins that are paſt our <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie;</hi> as there are many, thoſe we wind up in a <hi>generall,</hi> implicite <hi>confeſſion;</hi> as that <hi>Publican, O God be mercifull to me a ſinner:</hi> as here the Prophet teacheth them to ſay, <hi>Take away all.</hi> He would have them thereby acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their <hi>aggravation</hi> of ſin. <hi>All,</hi> that is, <hi>many,</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>many:</hi> nay, <hi>all,</hi> that is, <hi>all</hi> that can be ſaid. <hi>Take away all</hi> the iniquities that we can <hi>name,</hi> and all that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> can name, or that <hi>thou</hi> canſt lay to our charge. Lord, our ſins are <hi>great;</hi> as <hi>skarlet</hi> for <hi>die,</hi> as <hi>ſands</hi> for <hi>number:</hi> but <hi>one</hi> wipe with the <hi>ſpunge</hi> of thy <hi>mercie</hi> wil take away <hi>all:</hi> they are <hi>more</hi> then we can expreſſe, and <hi>number,</hi> there is an <hi>all</hi> of them: It is warrantable by the example of the Saints in Scripture: And that is one of the errors of <hi>auricular</hi> confeſſion that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> faſtens on
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114893:66"/>men, becauſe they tie men to reckon <hi>every</hi> ſinne, that is <hi>impoſſible;</hi> ſo they lay <hi>burthens</hi> on the conſciences of men.</p>
                  <p>It is true, it is the <hi>glory</hi> of Chriſtians to honour <hi>God</hi> by <hi>confeſſion,</hi> and he that ſtudies his <hi>heart</hi> moſt, knows his <hi>life</hi> moſt: but thoſe that we cannot <hi>reckon,</hi> it is an <hi>honour</hi> to God to reckon them up in <hi>generall</hi> phraſes, that we may give God the glory of <hi>aggravation.</hi> I <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe</hi> againſt my ſelfe whatſoever I <hi>know</hi> I have done, and I confeſſe what I have <hi>forgotten.</hi> There are ſinnes of my <hi>ſleepe</hi> that I cannot <hi>remember,</hi> and of my <hi>dreames,</hi> I <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe</hi> them. There are ſins of my <hi>cradle,</hi> I <hi>confeſſe</hi> to thee. There are ſinnes that I took no <hi>notice</hi> of, before I had <hi>knowledge,</hi> pardon <hi>all my iniquities.</hi> The Prophet would draw them to an acknowledgement of <hi>all.</hi> Every man hath an <hi>All.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if hee knew <hi>them</hi> to have an <hi>all,</hi> O what an <hi>all</hi> is that with which <hi>we</hi> are oppreſſed now? He that goes to reckon up the <hi>particulars</hi> of our <hi>general,</hi> the many <hi>ſpecies, &amp; kinds</hi> in this age: it is an <hi>all</hi> that fils the <hi>world,</hi> that fils <hi>heaven,</hi> that fils the <hi>eares</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> our ſins we confeſſe to thee, of <hi>thought,</hi> and <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>deed,</hi> of <hi>ignorance,</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> of <hi>preſumption,</hi> of <hi>infirmitie,</hi> our <hi>ſecret</hi> ſins, our open <hi>ſinnes,</hi> againſt <hi>thee,</hi> againſt our <hi>neighbours,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our <hi>ſelves.</hi> Thus a Chriſtian goes on to <hi>aggravate</hi> againſt himſelfe <hi>all</hi> theſe, and what ever <hi>elſe</hi> can bee ſaid. He that goes about to reckon our <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> our <hi>adulterie,</hi> our <hi>backeſlidings,</hi> the ſeverall degrees of our <hi>prophaneſſe;</hi> the ſhedding of innocent <hi>blood,</hi> how it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth: there hath been more <hi>blood</hi> ſhedde ſince the <hi>ſickeneſſe</hi> began, more <hi>duels</hi> about the City then I have heard of in two or three yeares before. As if we would <hi>aggravate</hi> ſinne, when God comes to <hi>reckon</hi> with us. If a man ſhould reckon the degrees of <hi>fraud</hi> that is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114893:67"/>continually practiſed in <hi>ſhops,</hi> and <hi>trades;</hi> the <hi>prophaning</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> &amp; ſin is come to that, that it is <hi>uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,</hi> that all the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in this <hi>Citie</hi> are not able to controll a few <hi>boyes,</hi> and diſorderly <hi>men,</hi> that <hi>wreſtle</hi> in the fields. So <hi>boyes</hi> give <hi>lawes</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> and ſo ſin runs on. The ſin that <hi>every</hi> man commits, if that be ſo <hi>infinite,</hi> the ſin that the <hi>whole</hi> commits, how <hi>infinite</hi> is it? We have an <hi>all,</hi> He would bring them to an <hi>acknowledgement,</hi> that is the firſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he would bring them to a <hi>deteſtation,</hi> and <hi>proteſtation</hi> againſt <hi>all.</hi> They come not to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> when they make <hi>confeſſion</hi> before God: take away our <hi>mortall</hi> ſins, but let our <hi>veniall</hi> ſins alone; our <hi>greater</hi> ſins wipe away; for our <hi>leſſe,</hi> we will ſhift as well as we can: True repentance knowes no ſuch <hi>diſtinction.</hi> Though there be a <hi>difference</hi> of ſins, yet in <hi>repentance,</hi> repentance makes <hi>none;</hi> not the <hi>diſtinction</hi> ſo as to <hi>exclude</hi> any. It makes <hi>diſtinction</hi> to <hi>mourn</hi> more for <hi>ſhipwracking</hi> ſinnes that <hi>burthen</hi> conſcience, and force, and <hi>ſtreine</hi> our <hi>teares;</hi> it mourns moſt for <hi>them,</hi> but it <hi>acknowledgeth all.</hi> If it be but as a graine of <hi>ſand,</hi> that it acknowledgeth, an <hi>idle</hi> word, an <hi>exorbitant</hi> thought, an <hi>irreligious</hi> geſture, <hi>indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, &amp; folly,</hi> they are fruits of the <hi>firſt</hi> ſin: and <hi>theſe,</hi> and <hi>every</hi> of theſe are oppoſite to the <hi>law.</hi> If it be a <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion</hi> of the <hi>law,</hi> it provokes the Divine <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> and is an <hi>obliquity</hi> from him, and incurs his <hi>juſtice,</hi> if God ſhould be <hi>extreame.</hi> Therefore when a Chriſtian askes <hi>pardon,</hi> he <hi>diſtinguiſheth</hi> not; here is the ſinne that I will lay <hi>aſide;</hi> and this is the ſin that I wil ask <hi>pardon</hi> of, no; he repents of <hi>none,</hi> that repents not of <hi>all.</hi> He diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth not the <hi>profitable,</hi> and the <hi>unprofitable</hi> ſins: here is a <hi>ſinne</hi> I am <hi>crucified</hi> to, ſaith the old man, I will aske God <hi>pardon</hi> of that: but <hi>covetouſneſſe</hi> ſticks to my fingers ends, I will not ask pardon of that. So, when <hi>nature</hi> is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114893:67"/>
                     <hi>weake</hi> in a <hi>drunkard,</hi> he will then acknowledge, I have offended <hi>God,</hi> and ſinned againſt the <hi>creatures</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate uſe of them; now he <hi>dares</hi> not, for his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> or he <hi>muſt</hi> not, for his <hi>dropſie.</hi> It is not <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> that cruciſies this ſin, but <hi>nature:</hi> but his <hi>gam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng,</hi> and <hi>intemperance,</hi> theſe he will keep. A true convert makes no <hi>diſtinction</hi> of <hi>pleaſant</hi> or <hi>unpleaſant</hi> ſinnes: no, here is my <hi>Dalilah,</hi> begin with that firſt, all <hi>iniquity</hi> is to be relinquiſhed; he that expects <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> muſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is another reaſon; that thereby hee might draw them to an acknowledgment of the great <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that he was able to pardon <hi>all. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all iniquity, all</hi> ſummed up together. By ſaying <hi>all,</hi> they acknowledg that God <hi>could</hi> and <hi>would</hi> remit <hi>all,</hi> if they repent of <hi>all,</hi> and leave <hi>all.</hi> Note, that there is no burthen of ſinne ſo <hi>great,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> can <hi>pardon</hi> it, and take it <hi>away.</hi> There is a greater <hi>all</hi> of <hi>Gods mercie,</hi> then of our <hi>ſinnes;</hi> and of <hi>Chriſts merits,</hi> then of our <hi>ſinnes;</hi> for <hi>all</hi> the ſins of the world put together, they are <hi>finite,</hi> he is an <hi>infinite</hi> Majeſtie: but in themſelves God can <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> them, for they are <hi>written in his booke.</hi> The alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of that <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice</hi> that Chriſt layd down, and the price of that <hi>inestimable</hi> blood, that is infinite. There can be no <hi>number</hi> made of the <hi>vertue</hi> of thoſe drops of <hi>blood</hi> which Chriſt ſhed: there can be no <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> made of that <hi>mercie,</hi> the drops of which God <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends</hi> us with, therefore <hi>mercie</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> is <hi>greater</hi> then ſin. If we can <hi>confeſſe all,</hi> God can <hi>pardon all.</hi> Look as in <hi>nature,</hi> the Philoſopher obſerved, that <hi>infinite</hi> is of that extent, that no <hi>finite</hi> can be proportionable: as an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number,</hi> though there can be none, becauſe another number may be added: but an <hi>infinite</hi> number, <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> millions, it is as far off of <hi>infinite</hi> as tenne, becauſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114893:68"/>there is no <hi>proportion,</hi> becauſe it may be <hi>multiplyed,</hi> and <hi>multiplyed.</hi> So, though <hi>ſins</hi> be <hi>many,</hi> as <hi>millions,</hi> it hath no <hi>proportion</hi> to the <hi>merits</hi> of Chriſt, why? becauſe they are <hi>infinite:</hi> that <hi>blood</hi> is of excellent <hi>vertue,</hi> it can waſh <hi>white;</hi> becauſe it is <hi>infinite,</hi> it hath ſufficiency to <hi>pardon all</hi> ſin, and do it eaſily.</p>
                  <p>So it is, as if he had ſaid: O Lord we are ready to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe all, take all away;</hi> what we can, we alleadg againſt our <hi>ſelves;</hi> we beſeech thee ſhew <hi>mercie.</hi> We know thy <hi>mercie</hi> is <hi>greater</hi> then our ſins; as we <hi>confeſſe all, pardon thou all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scripture ſets it out by an <hi>all</hi> too, <hi>the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> God hath made his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo: <hi>At what time ſoever a ſinner repenteth, I will blot out all his wickedneſſe.</hi> That thereby they might be drawn to <hi>acknowledge</hi> his <hi>gooodneſſe</hi> and <hi>mercie,</hi> to exclude their <hi>ſins;</hi> therefore the Prophet expreſſeth it by this <hi>all.</hi> Their ſins were <hi>innumerable,</hi> but Gods mercie is more <hi>innumerable:</hi> their ſins were <hi>great,</hi> but Gods mercie is <hi>greater;</hi> if they will have God to <hi>pardon all,</hi> they muſt <hi>confeſſe all,</hi> let this be the <hi>form</hi> you will uſe: that is the ſecond, the <hi>extent.</hi> Now, the third is the mayn, the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of the removall they pray for, <hi>Take away:</hi> But I ſee the time is paſt, therefore I will break off.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is one <hi>language</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> another of <hi>repentance,</hi> another of <hi>prayer,</hi> another of <hi>zeale,</hi> another of <hi>thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Each of theſe, they have ſeverall <hi>words,</hi> ſeverall kinds of <hi>dialects</hi> whereby they expreſſe themſelves.

                  <p>Each of theſe <hi>languages,</hi> and all ſorts of <hi>words,</hi> they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114893:69"/>have their particular <hi>tones,</hi> and <hi>acccents,</hi> whereby they expreſſe themſelves, whereby <hi>pronunciation</hi> is made. For faith <hi>forceth</hi> out her words, thankfulneſſe <hi>poures</hi> out her words, repentance <hi>drops</hi> them out, zeal <hi>flames</hi> them out, and prayer <hi>darts</hi> them out. There is none of all theſe <hi>languages,</hi> but we have a <hi>modell</hi> of them in this ſhort Scripture. The language of <hi>repentance,</hi> that is in thoſe words, <hi>Turne to the Lord.</hi> The language of <hi>prayer</hi> in thoſe, <hi>Take away all iniquity.</hi> The language of <hi>faith</hi> in thoſe, <hi>Receive us graciouſly.</hi> Of <hi>thankefulneſſe</hi> in thoſe, <hi>we will give the calves of our lips.</hi> And leſt any of theſe ſhould be wanting, we may find the fifth too, the language of <hi>zeale,</hi> that is in the Prophet that excited the people to theſe duties: <hi>Take with you words, and turne to the Lord,</hi> or <hi>turne to the Lord;</hi> and in <hi>turning,</hi> take <hi>words</hi> and ſay, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Some of theſe <hi>words</hi> I have ſpoken of already: you may remember I divided the whole into two parts, A rule of <hi>excitement,</hi> and a rule of <hi>direction.</hi> The <hi>excitement</hi> to <hi>two</hi> duties; the duty of <hi>action, Turne to the Lord,</hi> and the duty of <hi>elocution.</hi> In generall, <hi>take to you words:</hi> and in particular it hath reference to this forme, ſay <hi>thus</hi> to him, make your prayers after <hi>this;</hi> if you cannot doe that, uſe <hi>this prayer,</hi> that was the <hi>excitement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The rule of <hi>direction,</hi> or <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe</hi> that he gives them, followes. That conſiſts of <hi>two</hi> parts.</p>
                  <p>One part is for the <hi>donation</hi> of grace, <hi>Take away all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is <hi>promiſſorie</hi> for the <hi>returning</hi> of grace, the grace of <hi>thankefulneſſe. So will wee give the calves of our lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am yet in the former of theſe, and that conſiſts of <hi>two</hi> parts, the <hi>precatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:114893:69"/>
                  <p>One part is <hi>deprecatory,</hi> for the removall of <hi>ill, Take away all iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is <hi>ſupplicatory,</hi> that is, for the <hi>pouring</hi> out, or the effuſion of <hi>good,</hi> the beſt <hi>good,</hi> the good of <hi>grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us graciouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am yet in the former part, I conſidered <hi>three</hi> parts, according to the three <hi>words,</hi> for they have all their <hi>phaſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not, take away <hi>ſinne,</hi> but take away <hi>iniquity,</hi> it is a word of weight.</p>
                  <p>It is not take away <hi>our</hi> iniquities, or <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but <hi>all,</hi> the reaſon of that I gave alſo, the <hi>extent</hi> of it for the removing of <hi>all,</hi> you heard it.</p>
                  <p>The manner of removall that the people muſt beg, that is in this <hi>[Take away]</hi> all, a word that is very <hi>full,</hi> of a large ſignification. It is more then <hi>forgive.</hi> Compare it ſtrictly with the nature of the word, and it is more then <hi>crucifie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> of ſins, that properly concerns <hi>culpa.</hi> Sin may be <hi>committed</hi> where it is <hi>forgiven,</hi> according to the <hi>eſſence</hi> of it; it is not alway <hi>wholly crucified,</hi> and <hi>taken away.</hi> It is more then <hi>ſubdue,</hi> and <hi>mortifie,</hi> and keep <hi>under</hi> ſinne. Sin may be <hi>mortified,</hi> though the <hi>dregs,</hi> and <hi>lees,</hi> and <hi>ſeeds</hi> of it are ſtill behind, it ſhall never be put out <hi>wholly,</hi> out of any veſſel of election in <hi>this life.</hi> But this word in the prayer extends to both: <hi>Take away,</hi> both the <hi>ſtaine,</hi> take away the <hi>corruption,</hi> take away the <hi>guilt,</hi> take away the <hi>defilement:</hi> Take it out of <hi>thy ſight,</hi> that it <hi>accuſe</hi> us not, that it <hi>condemne</hi> us not, that it <hi>deſtroy</hi> us not, and expoſe us to thy <hi>judgements:</hi> and take it from <hi>us</hi> too, that it <hi>defile</hi> not, that it <hi>corrupt</hi> not, that it <hi>ſpread</hi> not. It is as much as thoſe two words in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>that forgives, and heales,</hi> and thoſe two in two, <hi>pardon;</hi> and <hi>cleanſe,</hi> it includes both, this <hi>taking away.</hi> Take it away
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114893:70"/>from <hi>us,</hi> and take it away from <hi>thee;</hi> let it have no more reſidence in <hi>our hearts,</hi> no more appearance in <hi>thine eyes,</hi> from <hi>below,</hi> from <hi>above,</hi> both <hi>take it away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay yet further, if we ſhall gather together all thoſe <hi>phraſes,</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> of ſpeech in Scripture, to expreſſe the <hi>pardon,</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſſe,</hi> and <hi>removing</hi> of ſinne, all comes within the compaſſe of this one phraſe. Not to <hi>obſerve</hi> ſin, not to <hi>impute</hi> it, not to <hi>remember</hi> it; to <hi>remove</hi> it, to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> it, to <hi>pardon</hi> it, to caſt it <hi>behind</hi> his back, to ſhut his <hi>eyes</hi> upon it, to caſt it into the bottome of the <hi>ſea;</hi> in a word, to <hi>purifie,</hi> to <hi>purge,</hi> to <hi>cleanſe</hi> us from it; there is as much in this one word, to <hi>take it away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a word ſo weighty, that that <hi>frivolous</hi> diſtinction that is uſed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the defence of their doctrine of <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> I wil not ſtand upon it, the diſtinction is this; that when ſin is <hi>pardoned,</hi> the pardon of ſin it extends in part to the <hi>guilt;</hi> but it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the <hi>removall</hi> of all <hi>puniſhment,</hi> becauſe there is the <hi>penal</hi> part of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> after to be performed in <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</hi> A diſtinction that will not ſtand before this word; to <hi>Take away:</hi> for if there be ſome <hi>puniſhment</hi> that God exacts ſtill, ſin is not <hi>taken away.</hi> It is a <hi>frivolous</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction that ſtands not with <hi>ſence;</hi> for that that is <hi>taken away</hi> is <hi>not;</hi> that that hath no <hi>entity</hi> hath no <hi>guilt,</hi> that that hath no <hi>being,</hi> obligeth not to <hi>puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is not only in it ſelfe <hi>frivolous,</hi> but <hi>injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as if his bleſſed <hi>merits,</hi> and <hi>interceſſion</hi> were able to quench the <hi>greater</hi> fire, and not to put out the <hi>leſſe,</hi> as if it were able to free from <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall</hi> death, and not from <hi>temporall,</hi> not a <hi>death,</hi> but a <hi>dying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, if God have <hi>pardoned,</hi> or <hi>taken away</hi> ſin for the <hi>merits</hi> of Chriſt, then it were <hi>unjuſt</hi> for God to exact it; A man that <hi>forgives</hi> a debt once, it is <hi>unjuſt</hi> to demand
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114893:70"/>it. If God have <hi>pardoned</hi> it, (and if he hath taken away ſinne, he hath <hi>pardoned</hi> it; if he have pardoned it,) how ſhall he be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> in puniſhing <hi>againe?</hi> He that is <hi>gracious</hi> in <hi>pardoning,</hi> will hee not be <hi>true</hi> in keeping his <hi>promiſe?</hi> Nay, he that is <hi>juſt</hi> in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>hee is juſt and faithfull to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſinne;</hi> will he be <hi>unjuſt</hi> in <hi>exacting</hi> that <hi>puniſhment</hi> that he hath <hi>remitted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, the queſtion is not about the pouring out of <hi>temporall</hi> puniſhments in this life; for ſo oft times God doth, even when he hath <hi>pardoned</hi> ſinne, he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth it in his <hi>deareſt</hi> ſervants: but thoſe are not <hi>puniſhments,</hi> but <hi>chaſtiſements,</hi> and <hi>inſtructions.</hi> So <hi>Davids,</hi> it was not ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> but a <hi>plaiſter</hi> that God laid to <hi>David</hi> to <hi>cure</hi> his ſinne, it was not a <hi>puniſhment</hi> inflicted for ſinne. That is not the queſtion about <hi>puniſhment</hi> continuing in <hi>this life,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>puniſhments.</hi> But the queſtion is about <hi>puniſhment properly</hi> ſo called <hi>after this life,</hi> whether it ſtand with Gods <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> or Chriſts <hi>merit,</hi> that there ſhould be any part of <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> after God hath <hi>pardoned,</hi> and <hi>taken away</hi> ſin.</p>
                  <p>It is a doctrine that will not ſtand before any of thoſe words whereby pardon of ſin is ſet forth in Scripture. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. God ſaith, he will <hi>caſt their ſins behind his backe;</hi> that is a <hi>full</hi> word. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. he ſaith, he will <hi>remove them as a cloud;</hi> that is another <hi>full</hi> word. In <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. he <hi>will caſt them into the bottom of the Sea;</hi> another <hi>full</hi> word. In <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. he ſaith, hee will <hi>not remember them,</hi> he will <hi>forget, &amp; forgive</hi> them. And here, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he will <hi>take them away.</hi> Their doctrine will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the tryall of theſe places, they cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if God <hi>puniſh,</hi> how doth he <hi>remove</hi> it? and if God <hi>revenge</hi> ſin, how doth he <hi>caſt</hi> it out of his <hi>preſence?</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:114893:71"/>how doth he <hi>forget</hi> it? for to <hi>puniſh</hi> is not only to <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> it, but <hi>ſharply</hi> to remember it, if the paines of <hi>purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> be ſo <hi>ſharp</hi> as they ſay.</p>
                  <p>But if we look to the phraſes, ſee how God expreſſeth the contrary, <hi>I will caſt them Behind my backe.</hi> How is that?

                  <p>Firſt, he would draw them to <hi>acknowledge</hi> that ſin was <hi>burthenſome,</hi> that they did <hi>deteſt,</hi> and <hi>loath</hi> it: For no man will have that <hi>taken away,</hi> that he <hi>delights</hi> in. It is plain, the Prophet would have them expreſſe ſuch <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> that it might appeare that their ſins were <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>abhominable,</hi> and they <hi>delighted</hi> not in them: no men would have that <hi>removed</hi> that they take <hi>pleaſure</hi> in. While ſin is but the <hi>paſtime</hi> of the <hi>impenitent</hi> heart, no man deſires it ſhould be <hi>taken away:</hi> but the prayer of a <hi>wicked</hi> mans heart is contrary, Lord, that I may <hi>fulfill</hi> my <hi>luſts,</hi> that my <hi>ſinnes</hi> may <hi>thrive,</hi> and goe on. Where ſin is <hi>ſweet,</hi> and <hi>delightfull,</hi> that man cannot <hi>wiſh</hi> that it ſhould be <hi>taken away,</hi> theſe are <hi>repugnant.</hi> But where a man wiſheth it to be <hi>taken away,</hi> and <hi>pardoned,</hi> it is plain there it appeares a <hi>burthen,</hi> and <hi>heavie.</hi> Looke, in any thing <hi>naturall,</hi> and <hi>civill:</hi> A <hi>ſervant,</hi> a man deſires not to put him away, while he is <hi>profitable,</hi> but if he be <hi>unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable.</hi> You caſt not away a <hi>garment</hi> while it is <hi>uſefull;</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:114893:72"/>but when you have done with it: when they will ſerve for your <hi>wearing,</hi> you will <hi>keepe</hi> them; no man will caſt a way that that he hath <hi>profit,</hi> or <hi>pleaſure</hi> by: It is either ſomewhat that is <hi>hurtfull,</hi> or <hi>unuſefull</hi> that men <hi>caſt away.</hi> So is the nature of <hi>ſinne;</hi> ſinne only is <hi>unprofitable: what fruit have you in thoſe things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Sinne</hi> is that which is only <hi>hurtfull,</hi> it expoſeth men to great <hi>danger:</hi> therefore if a man would truly <hi>prepare,</hi> and fit his <hi>heart,</hi> that he may ſpeak with <hi>enlarged</hi> affections for the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne, let him learn firſt to come to the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of it, to know that <hi>ſinne</hi> in its nature is a <hi>burthen. David</hi> calls it ſo; <hi>my iniquities are gone over my head: A heavy burthen, greater then Aetna,</hi> greater then all the <hi>mountaines</hi> pyled one upon another: but while ſin is <hi>pleaſing</hi> to the ſoule, ſo long it is not a <hi>burthen.

                  <p>If he oft repreſent the <hi>purity</hi> of that <hi>law</hi> that ſin <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth,</hi> the law of God.</p>

                  <p>The honour of that profeſſion that ſinne diſgraceth, the profeſſion of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>loſſe</hi> of that <hi>happineſſe</hi> that ſinne <hi>endamageth,</hi> the loſſe of <hi>heaven.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>comfort</hi> of that <hi>conſcience</hi> that ſin makes <hi>ſhipwrack</hi> of; that is, the conſcience that is <hi>within</hi> a man, that ſhall either be a veſſel of <hi>comfort,</hi> or <hi>woe.</hi> He that layes all theſe together, will begin to apprehend that <hi>ſin</hi> is <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome,</hi> that <hi>ſinne</hi> hath <hi>weight</hi> on it: and that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet provokes them to by this word. The word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to take a <hi>burthen</hi> from a man that is over-<hi>weary:</hi> So the ſame word is that that <hi>John</hi> uſeth concerning Chriſt, <hi>The Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> The <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>ſinne</hi> lay on the <hi>world,</hi> Chriſt comes, and <hi>takes it away;</hi> he takes it upon <hi>himſelfe,</hi> that he might take it from us: That they might underſtand thus much, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he chooſeth this word of <hi>weight.</hi> That is the <hi>firſt</hi> reaſon to bring them to this acknowledgment that their ſin was <hi>diſtastfull,</hi> and <hi>burthenſome,</hi> becauſe they could deſire God to <hi>take them away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, another thing it <hi>implies,</hi> is, hee would hereby bring them to the acknowledgment of the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin. He would hereby let them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand who alone is both <hi>able,</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>take away</hi> ſin. That is not in the power of any <hi>creature,</hi> or <hi>man</hi> himſelf, or any <hi>Angell,</hi> or <hi>Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or <hi>Saint</hi> whatſoever. Here is the ſecond thing requiſite in every <hi>true convert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, he muſt find ſin <hi>burthenſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he acknowledge <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>author</hi> of the <hi>pardon</hi> of it. It is in vaine to come before God, and not to know this. <hi>He that comes to God, muſt believe that he is.</hi> He that comes to God to <hi>remove</hi> his ſin, muſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114893:73"/>believe that <hi>God</hi> muſt <hi>remove</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>Shall we come to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> the <hi>merits</hi> of <hi>others</hi> to <hi>remove</hi> ſinne? It is to <hi>mock</hi> God. Let our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> look to this; though they pretend <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>author</hi> of <hi>pardon,</hi> yet let them ſee how it will ſtand with thoſe poynts. One concerning the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>merit:</hi> and the other concerning <hi>free-will.</hi> For if the Saints by the <hi>merit</hi> of their <hi>interceſſion,</hi> can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>pardon;</hi> or if thoſe, to whom the power of the <hi>keyes</hi> is committed, can <hi>properly, virtually, efficaciouſly,</hi> and <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly</hi> remove, and <hi>take away</hi> ſinne: it is plaine, they that hold theſe, cannot acknowledg <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>ſole author</hi> of <hi>pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Scripture runs in another phraſe: God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it ſo, and teſtifies of himſelfe, that <hi>none</hi> elſe can doe it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. <hi>I the Lord blot out your iniquities.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet acknowledgeth ſo much: <hi>To thee O Lord belongeth mercie and forgiveneſſe.</hi> As <hi>mercie</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> belong to God; ſo the <hi>taking away</hi> of ſinne, that is to thee <hi>alone,</hi> It hath the force of an <hi>excluſive,</hi> becauſe the <hi>depth</hi> of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> belongs to him: therefore <hi>forgiveneſſe.</hi>

                  <p>It is true, there is a power given to Miniſters <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,</hi> to <hi>publiſh,</hi> and <hi>pronounce</hi> pardon to the truly <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant:</hi> but the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>abſolution</hi> properly ſo called, and the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>taking away,</hi> and <hi>pardoning,</hi> that onely <hi>God</hi> keeps in his own cuſtodie. Saith <hi>Ambroſe</hi> well, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> of God doth that that belongs to <hi>his</hi> duty, when he <hi>declares,</hi> and publiſheth <hi>pardon</hi> to the <hi>repentant;</hi> but he exerciſeth not any <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> it is but <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall.</hi> Therefore Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves well, that when Chriſt gave this power to his Apoſtles, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>whoſe ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted:</hi> he firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, he <hi>breathed</hi> on them, and ſaid, <hi>receive yee the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Saith he, firſt they received the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and then <hi>whoſe ſinnes yeremit, they are remitted:</hi> For it is the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> that puts <hi>away</hi> ſinne, and not <hi>you:</hi> It is <hi>Auſtin's</hi> obſervation.</p>
                  <p>And we may further obſerve, that Chriſt, when hee <hi>healed</hi> any, commonly hee pronounced <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114893:74"/>ſinnes: but the Apoſtles, though they healed <hi>many,</hi> yet we never read that they uſed <hi>this</hi> word.

                  <p>This is the ſecond thing the Prophet would bring them to know and acknowledge in this word; <hi>O Lord to thee belongs mercie and forgiveneſſe;</hi> thou art the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercie:</hi> we can feel the <hi>ſmart</hi> of ſinne, but cannot <hi>remove</hi> it; thou muſt either <hi>take</hi> it <hi>away,</hi> or elſe it will not be taken <hi>away,</hi> therefore ſhew <hi>mercie,</hi> and come among us; either take <hi>it</hi> from <hi>us,</hi> or elſe it will take <hi>us</hi> from <hi>thee;</hi> remove it from <hi>us,</hi> and remove it from <hi>thee: Take away ſinne, and receive us graciouſly.</hi> I have done with the firſt part, the <hi>precatory</hi> part, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes <hi>Malum tollendum,</hi> the evill to be removed, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of ſin.</p>

                  <p>Two things are to be conſidered in it.</p>
                  <p>One that I propounded in the forenoon, though I came not to it; that is the <hi>connexion</hi> of <hi>this</hi> part to the <hi>other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is the <hi>order</hi> of <hi>this</hi> part with the <hi>other,</hi> why it is <hi>joyned,</hi> or <hi>added</hi> to the other clauſe, and why it <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes</hi> it; I ſhall hardly ſpeak of all.</p>
                  <p>But let us looke upon the <hi>connexion;</hi> why is this clauſe <hi>added</hi> to the other? Is not this enough; <hi>take away all iniquitie?</hi> It ſeemes this is <hi>ſuperfluous:</hi> for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>ſinne</hi> is <hi>pardoned, grace</hi> is <hi>conveyed:</hi> where <hi>GOD takes away</hi> ſinne, he diſcovers <hi>grace:</hi> and where hee <hi>crucifies</hi> the <hi>old</hi> man, he ſtamps the image of the <hi>new:</hi> where hee <hi>frees</hi> from <hi>death,</hi> he gives <hi>intereſt</hi> to <hi>life;</hi> where <hi>ſinne</hi> is <hi>pardoned, ſalvation</hi> is <hi>ſtated</hi> upon the ſoule; what need this follow? this one word, <hi>take away all iniquitie,</hi> is all the expreſſion that need to be uſed.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is a <hi>great</hi> diſproportion between <hi>yeares</hi> and <hi>months.</hi> In <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>The holy Citie ſhall be trodden down</hi> 42. <hi>months, but they ſhall reigne with me for a thouſand yeares.</hi> Though <hi>moneths</hi> be not <hi>moneths</hi> in that place, I come not now to examine the <hi>meaning</hi> of moneths: but ſee the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; there is <hi>mercy</hi> for a <hi>thouſand</hi> yeares, there is <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for 42. <hi>moneths:</hi> they ſhall be troden under foote, but they ſhall reign a thouſand yeares.</p>
                  <p>It is a greater <hi>diſproportion</hi> that is betwixt <hi>weeks</hi> and <hi>yeares:</hi> ſee that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>Seventy weekes are determined for the tranſgreſſion of my people, that I may compaſſe them with everlaſting kindneſſe.

                  <p>Yet further, there is a <hi>greater</hi> diſproportion between <hi>yeares</hi> and <hi>dayes:</hi> yet in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. <hi>The day of revenge is in mine heart, and the yeare of my redeemer is come.</hi> Here is the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>revenge,</hi> the <hi>yeare</hi> of <hi>redemption: The day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, to ſum it up, the Prophet would make them underſtand thus much, that nothing <hi>magnifies</hi> Gods <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe</hi> more then the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſinne: that they might <hi>profeſſe</hi> it, that they might make it <hi>publique</hi> to his glory; <hi>his glory it is to paſſe by tranſgreſſions,</hi> it is a great <hi>glory</hi> to paſſe by <hi>many</hi> tranſgreſſions, if it be his peculiar glory to paſſe by any. <hi>Where ſinne hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, grace abounds;</hi> where <hi>grace</hi> abounds, <hi>glory</hi> abounds, where <hi>much</hi> ſinne is pardoned, He cals them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his <hi>mercy,</hi> and makes it an <hi>illuſtration</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: <hi>Take away our tranſgreſſions, and receive us graciouſly.</hi> That is the firſt, it is a clauſe of <hi>illuſtration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve it as a clauſe of <hi>inducement,</hi> a <hi>motive</hi> and <hi>argument</hi> to <hi>perſwade</hi> God to <hi>forgive</hi> them. So, it ſtands thus, <hi>Take away iniquity,</hi> becauſe thou art <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> becauſe thou uſeſt to <hi>receive favourably,</hi> therefore take away <hi>iniquity.</hi> They begge for <hi>grace</hi> in the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> in the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>mercy;</hi> ſhew <hi>mercy,</hi> becauſe thou art <hi>mercifull,</hi> take away <hi>iniquity,</hi> becauſe thou art <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>favourable,</hi> therefore take away <hi>iniquity.</hi> It is the ſtrongeſt <hi>motive</hi> of all others, to preſſe God from <hi>himſelfe</hi> to <hi>pardon</hi> ſin. The point is this,</p>
                  <q>He that comes before God to begge for mercie, muſt bring no other motive but mercie.</q>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:114893:77"/>
                  <p>There is no ſuch ſtrong prevalent <hi>motive</hi> with God to ſhew <hi>mercy,</hi> as <hi>mercy; Mercy</hi> is the thing we <hi>ſue</hi> for, and <hi>mercy</hi> muſt make God ſhew it. He expreſſeth it ſo, <hi>I will pardon for my name ſake,</hi> in one place: <hi>For mine owne ſake,</hi> in another place: <hi>For my owne ſake will I doe this to the Houſe of Iſraell. For my promiſe ſake,</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; <hi>For my mercy ſake,</hi> in another place. Here are four, and they are all alike, to ſhew that <hi>mercy</hi> comes from it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> it hath a reciprocation, it moves <hi>circularly,</hi> it <hi>begins</hi> in <hi>mercy</hi> and it <hi>ends</hi> there. <hi>For mine owne ſake,</hi> that is, for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and his <hi>mercy</hi> is <hi>himſelfe. For my name ſake,</hi> that is, as much as for my <hi>mercy: Thy name is as Oyle powred out,</hi> and it appeares that his <hi>name</hi> is as <hi>Oyle,</hi> by his <hi>mercy,</hi> for <hi>mercy</hi> is that <hi>Oyle</hi> that <hi>Swims</hi> over <hi>all liquors,</hi> it <hi>appeares</hi> over all other works it is <hi>manifeſt</hi> to all: <hi>For my promiſe ſake,</hi> that is as much as for his <hi>mercy,</hi> for Gods <hi>Promiſes</hi> are <hi>Promiſes</hi> of <hi>mercy.</hi> So all agree in this, for my <hi>name</hi> ſake, it is a <hi>name</hi> of <hi>mercy;</hi> for my <hi>Promiſe</hi> ſake; they are <hi>Promiſes</hi> of <hi>mercy;</hi> for mine <hi>owne</hi> ſake, he is a <hi>God of mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet more plaine, when God ſpeakes of ſhewing <hi>mercy,</hi> he makes it come <hi>round,</hi> to ſhew that <hi>mercy</hi> is the thing that he will <hi>give,</hi> and the <hi>ground</hi> why he gives it, In <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</hi> See how it runs, it is thus, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will,</hi> that is, <hi>becauſe</hi> I will ſo, if we preſſe God for <hi>mercy,</hi> doe it thus. Lord be <hi>gracious,</hi> that thou <hi>mayeſt</hi> be <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and be <hi>mercyfull,</hi> becauſe thou <hi>art mercyfull: Pardon</hi> becauſe thou art <hi>gracious,</hi> thy mercy hath an everlaſting <hi>Duration.</hi> The Pſalmiſt preſſeth it ſo, <hi>Have mercy on me according to thy great goodneſſe, and according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy mercies take away mine offences;</hi> See how ſweetly he preſſeth it, <hi>Have mercy according to thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> he makes it come to it <hi>ſelfe; Pardon</hi> me according
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114893:78"/>to thy <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> be <hi>mercifull</hi> becauſe thou art <hi>mercifull:</hi> he had no other <hi>motive.</hi> In another place he hath the ſame <hi>Reciprocation, Doe good for thy name ſake, becauſe thou art good deliver me,</hi> becauſe thou art <hi>good,</hi> doe <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>deliver</hi> me. It is the ſame reciprocation that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. <hi>He hath beene good to the Houſe of Iſraell, for his goodneſſe, and becauſe his mercies are everlaſting.</hi> He hath beene good for his <hi>goodneſſe.</hi> To inſtance no more places, in the new Teſtament there is the ſame <hi>reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that <hi>John</hi> makes, <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>Of his fullneſſe we all receive grace for grace: mercy</hi> for <hi>mercy,</hi> it is not onely grace <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> grace, which is a good interpretation, the <hi>firſt</hi> grace, and the <hi>ſecond</hi> grace, the grace of <hi>Acceptation,</hi> and the grace of <hi>Strengthning;</hi> the grace of <hi>pardoning,</hi> and the grace of <hi>reviving</hi> and <hi>quickning,</hi> all grace is from God. But it hath a <hi>fuller</hi> ſignification, <hi>Grace for grace: Grace</hi> becauſe he is <hi>gracious,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>mercifull</hi> he ſhewes <hi>favour,</hi> he turnes it to <hi>himſelfe.</hi> So, now the Leſſion is this: that,
<q>When we come to ſue for pardon of ſin before the Throne of Grace, we have no name to come in but the name of Chriſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a name of <hi>mercy,</hi> that is <hi>Gods</hi> owne <hi>name;</hi> he that comes to plead his owne <hi>merit,</hi> comes in his owne name.

Our bleſſed Saviour hath taught us therefore ſo to pray, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes,</hi> he taught us not to pray as the Servant in the Goſpell, <hi>Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all,</hi> Lord be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable a little <hi>longer,</hi> lend me a little <hi>life,</hi> and I will make thee <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> No, that is not the Prayer, he that goes that way <hi>miſſeth;</hi> but here is the Prayer, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>forgive for thy name ſake,</hi> and for thy <hi>mercy ſake; Take away iniquity, and receive us favourably,</hi> receiue us to <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>Pardon</hi> for thy <hi>mercy ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>Forme</hi> that <hi>Penitent,</hi> faith full ſoules look to God in: No Creature is capable of <hi>merits,</hi> therefore let men never trouble themſelves with the diſcuſſion of <hi>that,</hi> it is ſo repugnant that the <hi>Angells,</hi> though they never <hi>ſinned,</hi> cannot <hi>merit,</hi> they doe but their <hi>duty. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in integrity could not <hi>merit,</hi> if <hi>innocency</hi> cannot <hi>merit, ſin cannot,</hi> if the State of <hi>Angells</hi> cannot <hi>merit, humane</hi> cannot. Nay, the <hi>Saints</hi> that are called out of <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſanctified</hi> by grace, thoſe Saints, though it were poſſible they ſhould never <hi>ſin,</hi> not ſo much as in the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of any good Act; that they ſhould not be touched with <hi>veniall</hi> ſins (as they call them) with no ill <hi>thought,</hi> or <hi>idle word,</hi> or unprofitable <hi>geſture,</hi> if they were borne, and <hi>ſanctified from the womb,</hi> as <hi>John Baptiſt, and Jeremiah,</hi> and ſhould continue in a <hi>courſe</hi> of ſanctification, without any treading <hi>awry,</hi> they could not <hi>merit,</hi> when they had done all, they muſt ſay, <hi>They were unprofitable Servants.</hi> He that doth his <hi>duty</hi> cannot merit; ye are but <hi>Servants</hi> when you have done all you <hi>can,</hi> nay, when you have done all you <hi>ſhould</hi> (if it were poſſible) that is more then all you <hi>can:</hi> For that <hi>grace</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:114893:79"/>that God gives us, though it be a good evidence of his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and of <hi>juſtification</hi> in our hearts; yet that grace of <hi>ſanctification</hi> is <hi>imperfect,</hi> and no man makes a perfect improvement of Gods gifts, no man lives according to the <hi>meaſure</hi> of grace that God beſtowes. Therefore when we have done all we <hi>can,</hi> we come ſhort of what we <hi>ought.</hi> Nay, if we had done all we <hi>ſhould,</hi> all that God requires, ſay, you cannot <hi>merit,</hi> you <hi>are unprofitable Servants,</hi> you <hi>have done but your duty,</hi> you have done but what God <hi>requires.</hi> If the ſtate of <hi>reſtitution</hi> cannot <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſin</hi> and <hi>impiety</hi> cannot <hi>merit.</hi> There is in the <hi>beſt</hi> action that we performe, in the work of <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>alms,</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> and deeds of <hi>piety,</hi> ſo much <hi>Leaven,</hi> ſo many <hi>infirmities,</hi> that he that knowes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>ſin,</hi> and the latitude, and <hi>ſmall</hi> extent of <hi>piety,</hi> in his heart, when he <hi>Prayes</hi> he <hi>prayes</hi> not onely for the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of his <hi>ſins,</hi> but of his <hi>Prayers.</hi> And when he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he prayes not onely for <hi>pardon</hi> of his <hi>ſilence,</hi> and <hi>neglect,</hi> but of his <hi>performance;</hi> if there be infirmities in the <hi>beſt,</hi> there is no plea of <hi>merit.</hi> Our work is onely this, to flie to the Throne of <hi>grace,</hi> in the name of <hi>grace,</hi> that is it that is a <hi>prevaling,</hi> forcible word with God, to plead for <hi>mercy,</hi> and beg for <hi>pardon,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> It is a word that ſo <hi>prevailes,</hi> that it carries alway <hi>mercy</hi> with it from Heaven, it is that word that God <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi> in; it is that word about which prayer <hi>clucks,</hi> as the Wings of the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> about the <hi>Mercy-Seate:</hi> The <hi>Wings</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt <hi>flutter</hi> about the <hi>Mercy-ſeate,</hi> about <hi>mercy.</hi> That is the ſecond thing, to ſhew what the <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin is; none but mercy, it is founded in grace, therefore he adds it to the former, <hi>Take away all iniquity and receive us graciouſly,</hi> as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to perſwade God to take away <hi>all iniquity.</hi> That is the ſecond, I will but touch the third.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:114893:79"/>
                  <p>The Third is, he adds it as a clauſe of <hi>perfection,</hi> that makes up the perfect <hi>enumeration</hi> of the <hi>graces, Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all iniquity and receive us graciouſly.</hi> There is <hi>nothing</hi> that a Chriſtian can beg in this World, but it may be brought in the compaſſe of one of theſe <hi>two.</hi> Theſe <hi>two</hi> words are as the two <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> like the <hi>two</hi> Tables of the <hi>Law,</hi> in theſe two, there are all kind of Petitions, all the <hi>evill</hi> that is to be <hi>removed,</hi> is in that, <hi>Take away all iniquity,</hi> and all <hi>good</hi> that is to be conveyed in that, <hi>Receive us graciouſly.</hi> So, that he might make a <hi>Perfect</hi> Prayer for them, yet very <hi>ſhort</hi> and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and yet <hi>full. Take away all iniquity and receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly,</hi> this is a Prayer that the <hi>Prophet ſtudied,</hi> this was the Prayer that the <hi>Spirit</hi> guided him to make for them. Here are the two hands of Prayer, <hi>Take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we divide Prayer, as the Apoſtle doth, into foure ſorts, that are rather <hi>parts</hi> then <hi>kinds</hi> of Prayer, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>I beſeech that Prayer, and interceſſion, and giving of thanks, be made to God for all men,</hi> they are all in this forme that the Prophet preſcribes them: Here is the <hi>deprecatory</hi> part for the <hi>removing</hi> of <hi>ill; Take away all iniquity,</hi> here is the <hi>ſupplicatory</hi> part; for the pouring out of all <hi>good, Receive us graciouſly.</hi> Here is the <hi>gratulatory</hi> part, <hi>We will give the Calves of our lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take the diviſion of Prayer, according to that ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that <hi>David</hi> makes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. For <hi>obedience</hi> gives the Law to Prayer, he refers the <hi>duty</hi> of a Chriſtian to <hi>two</hi> heads, <hi>Eſchew evill, and doe good,</hi> upon that <hi>hangs all the Law, and the Prophets:</hi> according to theſe two are the parts of Prayer, one for the <hi>removall</hi> of <hi>evill,</hi> another for the <hi>infuſion</hi> of <hi>grace;</hi> here are both, the <hi>removall</hi> of the greateſt <hi>evill, take away iniquity,</hi> and powre the choiceſt of thy <hi>mercies</hi> on us; that is mercy, <hi>Receive us graciouſly.</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:114893:80"/>One part of the Prayer is for expelling of <hi>darkneſse, Take away iniquity,</hi> the other for the ſhewing of the <hi>light</hi> of his Countenance, <hi>Receive us graciouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if we divide it, as <hi>David</hi> divides prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. there he makes his Prayer, <hi>Remember Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not;</hi> theſe are the two heads, an <hi>affirmative,</hi> and a <hi>negative, remember not</hi> my <hi>ſins,</hi> but <hi>remember me:</hi> He deſires God, both to <hi>remember,</hi> and yet to <hi>forget;</hi> here are both theſe, here is one part of the Prayer, that God would be <hi>mindfull, receive us graciouſly:</hi> Another that he would <hi>not</hi> be <hi>mindfull, Take away iniquity,</hi> remove it out of thy <hi>ſight, forget</hi> our <hi>ſins,</hi> Here is one part, that God would open his eyes, and another that he would <hi>ſhut</hi> them, <hi>ſhut</hi> them upon our <hi>ſins, open</hi> them upon our <hi>perſons.</hi> The one part of the Prayer fits the <hi>ſin,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>ſinner:</hi> For <hi>ſin,</hi> they pray that God would put it <hi>from</hi> them, and <hi>remove</hi> it; for <hi>themſelves,</hi> they pray that God would <hi>take</hi> them to him, and <hi>receive</hi> them to mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Men,</hi> when they puniſh <hi>ſin,</hi> they cut off the <hi>Sinner;</hi> but they cannot take away the <hi>ſin:</hi> God is otherwiſe in his proceeding, he takes away the <hi>ſin,</hi> and ſpares the <hi>Sinner.</hi> To make up the <hi>perfect part</hi> of Prayer, here is the <hi>evill</hi> to be <hi>removed,</hi> and the <hi>grace</hi> to be <hi>beſtowed, Take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly,</hi> here is that that concernes the <hi>time paſt, Lord take away iniquity,</hi> what we <hi>have</hi> done thou knoweſt, here is that that concernes the <hi>time to come,</hi> that we fall no <hi>more,</hi> ſtrengthen us by thy ſpirit, <hi>receive us graciouſly.</hi> As <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, it is the <hi>breviary</hi> of the whole <hi>Goſpell;</hi> as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaith, it is the <hi>Compendium</hi> of all Heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. This text here is all the Goſpell, and all that is <hi>good</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> it is the ſumme of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> it is like the Lords Prayer; here are ſix words in it anſwerable
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114893:80"/>to the ſix Petitions. <hi>Take away iniquity and receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly,</hi> as Chriſt divides that Prayer, he refers all to <hi>two</hi> heads, one for <hi>deprecation</hi> of <hi>ill. Forgive us our Treſpaſſes, and lead us not into temptation, deliver us from evill.</hi> The other for the powring out of all <hi>good, Hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdome come, thy will be done, and give us day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread.</hi> So here is for the <hi>removall</hi> of <hi>evill,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrengthning</hi> to <hi>grace, take away iniquity and receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a <hi>Patterne</hi> for us, one <hi>halfe</hi> of his Prayer is ſpent for the <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> the other <hi>halfe</hi> for the <hi>powring out</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> For a man to neglect to beg pardon, that is to be unmindfull of the <hi>time paſt,</hi> he that begs not <hi>grace,</hi> is unmindfull of the <hi>time to come.</hi> By <hi>pardon</hi> we <hi>returne,</hi> and by <hi>grace</hi> we <hi>ſtand.</hi> He that hath the <hi>conſideration</hi> of Hell, that will ſtir him up to beg <hi>pardon,</hi> and he that ſees the joyes of <hi>Heaven</hi> will beg grace; for that is the <hi>path</hi> that leads thither: to make a perfect prayer, joine both. The Prophet to give them a full forme, he joynes theſe, though briefly. None of them could plead, that they were not <hi>able</hi> to learne it, he joynes theſe, that <hi>we</hi> might learne to joyne them in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They are the things that <hi>God</hi> joynes, therefore <hi>he</hi> joines them. They are the things that the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God joyne, therefore <hi>he</hi> joynes them. They are the things that <hi>other</hi> Saints joyned, therefore <hi>he</hi> joynes them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God,</hi> when he ſpeakes of himſelfe he joynes theſe, <hi>The Lord, the Lord, gracious, and mercifull, pardoning ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, &amp;c.</hi> They goe together in <hi>God,</hi> can a man make a <hi>better</hi> prayer to God, or more <hi>perfect,</hi> then that that is taken from thoſe <hi>Attributes,</hi> and termes that are moſt <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynent</hi> in God? The Spirit of God joynes theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>God,</hi> we may well joyne them in <hi>Prayer.</hi> As <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:114893:81"/>ſaith of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> it is good to come to the Lord in his <hi>owne</hi> words, though there be no <hi>vertue</hi> in the <hi>words</hi> without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> God will accept the words of his owne <hi>Son,</hi> when we come in the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So here, it is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God that <hi>commenceth,</hi> and makes our <hi>Suites,</hi> it is the Spirit of God that frames our <hi>Bill,</hi> that <hi>Dictates</hi> our <hi>Prayers:</hi> He is the <hi>Counſellor</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> he knowes what the Father will grant. Shall we neglect to make ſuch Prayers as the <hi>Spirit</hi> dictates? Can you have, ſayth St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> a better to <hi>Coppy</hi> your Prayers, then the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God? Then, here the Spirit of God joynes the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of God, we muſt joine them in our Prayers, God will <hi>acknowledge</hi> the words of his Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> if we come to Chriſt in his <hi>owne</hi> words.</p>
                  <p>As they are the words that <hi>God</hi> joynes, ſo they are the words that are joyned in the <hi>Promiſe: I will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to their Tranſgreſſions, and I will pardon their Sins.</hi> In many of the Promiſes of God theſe two ſtill meet; <hi>Prayer</hi> builds upon a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> when <hi>Prayer</hi> gets a <hi>promiſe,</hi> it builds, it goes up to <hi>Heaven</hi> upon <hi>promiſes,</hi> there is the <hi>Ladder</hi> of <hi>promiſes.</hi> It is impoſſible Prayer ſhould <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,</hi> that takes the direction of the <hi>promiſe;</hi> God hath <hi>promiſed</hi> to <hi>pardon,</hi> therefore prayer ſues for it, God hath <hi>promiſed</hi> to be <hi>gracious,</hi> therefore prayer begs it. Theſe two are joyned in the <hi>promiſe,</hi> therefore they ſhould in our <hi>Prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are the <hi>two</hi> that the <hi>Saints</hi> joyne, <hi>God be mercifull to us and bleſſe us, and be mercifull unto us;</hi> he <hi>delights</hi> to put theſe <hi>two,</hi> God be <hi>mercifull,</hi> and <hi>mercifull,</hi> God <hi>take away our ſins,</hi> and <hi>receive us graciouſly;</hi> be <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> in <hi>pardoning,</hi> and be <hi>mercifull</hi> in <hi>powring</hi> out, and <hi>diffuſing</hi> the <hi>light</hi> of thy <hi>Countenance.</hi> O! when the <hi>Saints</hi> ſet before us the Patterns of ſuch Prayers, it is <hi>comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:114893:81"/>to us; ſuch Patterns as they <hi>ſped</hi> with, when they were in our condition. It is a great <hi>incouragement</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> to a Chriſtian, when I come with the Prayer of <hi>David,</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> O! It is a comfort when a ſoule can enlarge it ſelfe in thoſe <hi>Heavenly</hi> words that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God wrought in the hearts of the <hi>Saints</hi> in former times. For this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Prophet records this Prayer, that <hi>they</hi> might learne it then, and <hi>we</hi> treaſure it up now, for it is full of the <hi>Jewells</hi> of Heavenly grace. That ſhall ſerve, to have ſpoken of that, <hi>Take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly,</hi> the <hi>reaſon</hi> why he adds this clauſe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>Firſt, for the removall of <hi>ſin, Take away all iniquity,</hi> I ſhewed you the <hi>reaſons</hi> why he directs his prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>ſin;</hi> why he would have them direct it againſt <hi>all</hi> ſin; why he Prayes againſt ſin, for the taking of it away.</p>
                  <p>The 2. part of the prayer is, for the powring down of the <hi>grace</hi> they ſtood in need of, <hi>receive us mercifully, favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> receive us to thy <hi>grace,</hi> In that, I ſhewed you the <hi>reaſons</hi> why it is <hi>annexed</hi> to the former part, as a clauſe of <hi>Illustration,</hi> ſhew thy ſelfe <hi>Gracious</hi> by <hi>pardoning</hi> our ſins.</p>
                  <p>As a clauſe of <hi>inducement,</hi> we intreat thee for the goodneſſe of thy <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> to ſhew thy ſelfe ſo in <hi>pardoning</hi> our ſins; we come to God for <hi>grace,</hi> in the name of <hi>Grace,</hi> and for <hi>Mercy</hi> in the name of <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as a clauſe that makes up a perfect <hi>Ennu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration</hi> of all wants that are compriſed under theſe two heads. <hi>Take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly.</hi> Thus ſarr I went.</p>
                  <p>That that remaines in the ſecond part, is onely the <hi>Order</hi> of theſe two particulars: For there is ſome <hi>reaſon</hi> why the Prophet ſets them in this <hi>Order.</hi> Why not firſt, <hi>receive us graciouſly,</hi> and then <hi>Take away iniquity?</hi> for all other bleſſings are Originated in the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> of God: It is from his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> that he grants <hi>pardon</hi> to us of our Tranſgreſſions; there is no <hi>pardon</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:114893:84"/>of ſin, where there is not <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> Therefore the Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. he ſets them in another Order, <hi>O Lord thou haſt beene gracious to the Land.</hi> And then followes in Verſ. 2. <hi>Thou haſt forgiven the iniquities of thy People.</hi> Firſt God is <hi>gracious,</hi> and then he <hi>forgives</hi> iniquity, the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin muſt flow from his <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, the <hi>love</hi> of God muſt of neceſſity goe before, (in the order of nature) all the <hi>effects</hi> of his love, and favour whatſoever: the <hi>cauſe</hi> muſt be before the <hi>effect,</hi> and the <hi>Fountaine</hi> before the <hi>Streame</hi> in <hi>nature.</hi> But yet the Scripture uſeth ſome difference of ſetting downe theſe particulars: for ſometimes it ſets the <hi>one</hi> before, and ſometimes the <hi>other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe they are mutually <hi>infolded,</hi> and ſo cloſe <hi>knit,</hi> that one cannot be without the other: There is no greater demonſtration of Gods <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> then the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin; if there be grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, there will be <hi>forgiveneſſe,</hi> where there is <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> there is an evident teſtimony that God hath ſhewed the riches of his <hi>grace;</hi> therefore though the Prophet ſet it here in another order, then ſometimes, it is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is good reaſon for it; beſides that; there may be three things ſaid, for the juſtification of this order, there are three reaſons of it.</p>
                  <p>Eyther as they conteine in them a Petition for the enlargement of the <hi>continuance</hi> of grace.</p>
                  <p>Or for the enlargment of the <hi>Evidence</hi> and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of grace.</p>
                  <p>Or a Petition for the enlargment of the <hi>communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his grace to them. In all theſe 3. ſences the order is every way juſtifiable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in putting theſe two together, there is a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the inlargment of the <hi>continuance</hi> of Gods grace,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114893:84"/>
                     <hi>Take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly:</hi> In theſe two he prayes for the <hi>giving</hi> of grace, and the <hi>duration</hi> and <hi>perpetuation</hi> of it. So the order is thus, <hi>Grace</hi> cannot be <hi>continued,</hi> till it be <hi>beſtowed</hi> and given: In the firſt word he prayes for the <hi>giving</hi> of it, that God would <hi>receive</hi> them to a ſtate of reconciliation. In the ſecond, that he would <hi>continue</hi> them, and <hi>keepe</hi> them in that eſtate. Shew thy ſelfe <hi>firſt</hi> gracious in <hi>pardoning</hi> our ſins, and ſhew thy ſelfe <hi>againe</hi> gracious in keeping us from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſin. What profits it, though our <hi>former</hi> ſins be <hi>pardoned,</hi> if we <hi>continue</hi> in them? Therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet teacheth them to beg, not onely for <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> of ſins, but for <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> of grace to <hi>continue</hi> in it. To ſhew, that apenitent faithfull ſoul ſtands in need of God, after his ſins are <hi>pardoned.</hi> We have not done with God when our ſins are <hi>pardoned,</hi> we need a further <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment</hi> of grace to keep us in that eſtate, leſt we relaps. Therefore the beleiving ſoul makes up his Prayer of theſe two, Lord, thou <hi>haſt</hi> been gracious, and I rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee for the time to <hi>come,</hi> that thou <hi>wilt</hi> ſtill. The Point is this: that,
<q>The faithfull ſoul after it hath had a taſt of the goodneſſe of God, in the pardon of ſin, it reſts not there, but goes on ſtill to beg more grace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A greater <hi>enlargement</hi> of favour; it muſt needs be ſo in the order of our deſires. <hi>Grace</hi> is of a raviſhing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when it poſſeſſeth the heart, it <hi>inflames</hi> it. Even in <hi>Heaven,</hi> where <hi>grace</hi> is <hi>full,</hi> there is an <hi>Apetite</hi> of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:114893:85"/>for deſire of the continuance of that <hi>grace,</hi> and favour: though there cannot be a deſire of <hi>more,</hi> where the Veſſell is <hi>full.</hi> But in Earth, where grace is powred in by <hi>drops,</hi> there is an Appetite of <hi>deſire,</hi> becauſe there is <hi>want</hi> continually. And we never have grace, but that we ſee we want <hi>more,</hi> then a man <hi>loves</hi> grace <hi>more,</hi> when God <hi>powres</hi> in <hi>more,</hi> and he thinks he wants more.</p>
                  <p>It is the order in Gods proceeding, he layes this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, he gives his ſpirit for this purpoſe, not onely to <hi>cleanſe</hi> us from ſin, but to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> us for new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not onely to Seale to us our <hi>reconciliation</hi> for the preſent, but to keepe us for the time to <hi>come.</hi> And both theſe are the free gift, and work of Gods Spirit; it is his ſpirit that ſeales to us <hi>pardon,</hi> and it is his ſpirit that <hi>ſtrengtheneth</hi> us, that we may walke by the ſtrength of that grace.</p>
                  <p>And the order of our <hi>neceſſity</hi> is ſuch: For otherwiſe how ſhould we doe? It is <hi>by grace we ſtand,</hi> and <hi>riſe,</hi> and <hi>goe</hi> on, and <hi>perſevere.</hi> A Chriſtian ſtands in need of God in <hi>all</hi> the paſſages of his life, every <hi>minute,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>moment</hi> of time, for <hi>temporalls,</hi> for <hi>ſpiritualls,</hi> for <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we looke to thoſe things of nature that we need. Firſt, it is the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of God that muſt give a man <hi>meat</hi> for his body: And aftermear, it is a ſecond grace to give him a <hi>Stomack:</hi> And after that, it is a third good to give him <hi>digeſtion:</hi> And after that, it is a fourth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of goodneſſe, to turne it to <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſpirits,</hi> that it may be healthfull.</p>
                  <p>So for <hi>temporalls,</hi> it is one Teſtimony of goodneſſe, that he <hi>keeps</hi> us from <hi>danger.</hi> It is a ſecond that he keeps us in the <hi>right</hi> way: And it is a third that he brings us ſafe to the <hi>end</hi> of our journey.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things much more; if God ſhould firſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114893:85"/>
                     <hi>prevent</hi> us with grace, and then leave us to our ſelves, what ſecurity could we have? Our <hi>latter end would be worſe then our beginning.</hi> We are not able to ſubſiſt of our ſelves <hi>one</hi> moment of time, Gods grace muſt have the <hi>glory</hi> and honour of all; that it may have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the Prophet here teacheth them thus to pray for the <hi>firſt</hi> grace, and the <hi>ſecond</hi> grace, for the <hi>beginning,</hi> and for the <hi>continuance</hi> of grace, to work the <hi>will</hi> and the <hi>Deed,</hi> that he would <hi>perfect</hi> the work. Firſt, <hi>Take away iniquity,</hi> ſhew thy ſelfe <hi>gracious</hi> in <hi>pardoning;</hi> and then <hi>continue</hi> that grace, keep us from ſinning <hi>againo.</hi> That is the firſt juſtification, if we conſider the <hi>enlargement</hi> of the <hi>continuance,</hi> ſo the order is good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we conſider it as a Petition for the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement</hi> of the <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of grace, ſo it is good. For grace cannot be <hi>manifeſted</hi> till it be <hi>given,</hi> there can be no <hi>demonſtration</hi> of the pardon of ſin, till pardon be <hi>wrought,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>demonſtration</hi> of the pardon of ſin is this, when Gods ſpirit is powerfull to <hi>ſubdue</hi> and <hi>crucifie</hi> ſin. Then it is this demonſtration they beg in the ſecond place, <hi>pardon</hi> our iniquities, and give us <hi>evidence</hi> that our ſins are pardoned, that thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit affiſt us continually to <hi>crucifie</hi> and <hi>ſubdue</hi> our ſins: <hi>beſtow</hi> upon us grace and favour and make us <hi>know</hi> that we have it. For as our <hi>happineſſe</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>pardon</hi> of our ſins, ſo the <hi>comfort</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>enjoying</hi> of it. It is true, that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin may be <hi>had,</hi> where it is not at all times <hi>ſeene</hi> and <hi>felt,</hi> and <hi>perceived;</hi> but yet it cannot be <hi>enjoyed,</hi> unleſſe it be <hi>ſeene</hi> and <hi>felt;</hi> we may have the <hi>thing,</hi> but <hi>want</hi> the <hi>comfort</hi> ſometimes. He that wants the <hi>comfort,</hi> for the time he wants the <hi>thing</hi> to himſelfe, and his apprehenſion. Therefore when God hath pardoned, and hath ſhewed <hi>grace,</hi> the faithfull ſoul ſtaies not there, it is a <hi>Heaven</hi> upon <hi>Earth</hi> to have the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114893:86"/>
                     <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance,</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> of grace; that is the point: that,
<q>After the pardon of ſin is had, the faithfull ſoul ſtaies not there, but begs for aſſurance, and after that, for more aſſurances, and ſtill for more aſſurance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe, there may be enlargement of <hi>aſſurance</hi> ſtill, as long as we are in theſe dayes of <hi>miſery.</hi> However it pleaſe our adverſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> to make a mock of the <hi>certeinty</hi> of Salvation, the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of grace, they pin ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcornes upon it in their writings, though they be the Learned of them; let them injoy their conſolation, it is to be feared that they will want the <hi>comfort,</hi> that thus deride it. The Saints in Scripture did not ſo, they directed their prayers oft times, not onely for the <hi>thing,</hi> but for the <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of it; and as they rejoyced in the <hi>thing,</hi> ſo much more in the <hi>aſſurance,</hi> for the preſent. Looke over thoſe in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, and in the <hi>New.</hi> Heare the tryumph of <hi>Job,</hi> wherein he wonderouſly delights and refreſheth himſelfe. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that I ſhall ſee him with theſe eyes.</hi> There is no word of greater <hi>aſſurance</hi> then this, <hi>I know.</hi> Let their <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſpeake his mind of that word, upon thoſe words. <hi>I know whom I have belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. ſayth he, in this word, <hi>I know,</hi> there is a certainty and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of <hi>hope,</hi> that <hi>hope</hi> that makes us not <hi>confounded:</hi> there is a certainty in this word, <hi>I know, I know that my redeemer liveth.</hi> Therefore <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. he prayes not onely God to <hi>cleanſe,</hi> and <hi>pardon,</hi> and <hi>purifie</hi> his ſins, but then followes, <hi>Make me to heare the voice of joy and gladneſſe: Cleanſe</hi> me, and make me <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi> that thou haſt <hi>cleanſed</hi> me, make me have the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114893:86"/>
                     <hi>comfort</hi> of it. Thou haſt told me already, that my ſins are <hi>pardoned,</hi> I have the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of it by the Meſſage ſent by <hi>Nathan,</hi> but there wants <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> in the <hi>evident</hi> demonſtration of it. <hi>O make me to heare the voyce of joy and gladneſſe, that the bones that thou haſt broken may rejoyce:</hi> that I may have the evidence of thy ſpirit ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to my heart.</p>
                  <p>Looke to the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, it is that perticular, in which the Holy Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> delights, and refreſheth himſelfe, not onely in the <hi>thing,</hi> but in the <hi>comfort</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the certainty, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>We know,</hi> there is <hi>Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Jobs</hi> word againe, <hi>We know that we are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from death to life,</hi> it is God that hath <hi>pardoned</hi> our ſins, and wrought this gracious change. There is a tranſlation of the <hi>Old</hi> man to the <hi>New,</hi> we are tranſlated, and we know it by the fruit and effect, <hi>becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> And in another place, <hi>We know his ſpirit abides in us.</hi> He not onely <hi>comes,</hi> and <hi>goes,</hi> but <hi>dwells,</hi> he hath taken up his <hi>Habitation,</hi> it <hi>continues</hi> with us, we <hi>know</hi> it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the <hi>Spirit;</hi> there is the <hi>evidence</hi> from the <hi>effect,</hi> becauſe we <hi>love the Brethren,</hi> we know it by that; and from the <hi>cauſe</hi> we know it, becauſe we have the <hi>Spirit.</hi> What is more then we <hi>know?</hi> And what greater <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> then the <hi>Spirit? Paul</hi> makes that the great <hi>evidence, Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>We know that he hath given us of his ſpirit:</hi> And that Spirit <hi>witneſſeth,</hi> what? That our ſins are <hi>pardoned,</hi> that we are the <hi>Children of God,</hi> that we are in the ſtate of <hi>Adoption,</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation. The Spirit witneſſeth to our Spirits. Our</hi> ſpirits have the Teſtimony, and <hi>the</hi> ſpirit <hi>adds a Teſtimony</hi> to that, that <hi>by the mouth of two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes every word of God might be eſtabliſhed</hi> to the ſoule. There <hi>is</hi> the <hi>evidnce</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of <hi>our</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; of the ſpirit of <hi>God.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is very free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in ſetting words of weight to evince the <hi>certeinty
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114893:87"/>I am perſwaded that neither life nor death, nor Angells, nor Principallities, nor powers, nor any thing ſhall be able to ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the love of God.</hi> I am <hi>perſwaded,</hi> it is a word of great <hi>aſſurance,</hi> I am <hi>confident,</hi> it is as much as <hi>we know,</hi> I am <hi>aſſured</hi> that neither <hi>life,</hi> nor <hi>death,</hi> that nothing can <hi>ſeperate</hi> this bond of <hi>union,</hi> or <hi>cut</hi> this bond aſſunder. There is no Sword that can cut betweene the beleiving <hi>ſoule,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God. It is ſo <hi>neare</hi> a union, that the love of God makes, that <hi>nothing</hi> can come between, I am <hi>confident,</hi> I am <hi>aſſured</hi> that neither <hi>principallities,</hi> nor <hi>powers,</hi> nor any thing ſhall be <hi>able to ſeperate us from the love of God,</hi> he had the <hi>evidence,</hi> and he ſhewes that it <hi>might</hi> therefore be <hi>had.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet another place, and that is that that before I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>I know whom I have beleived.</hi> It is not onely put in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. in the <hi>Singular,</hi> but in the <hi>Plur all,</hi> leaſt men ſhould have thought that <hi>Paul</hi> had it by <hi>illumination</hi> from God, it was revealed to him from Heaven; <hi>He</hi> knew <hi>whom he had beleived,</hi> and that none could ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate him; but ſhall <hi>we</hi> expect to have that aſſurance given us? Therefore in the Corinths he takes in them, <hi>We know,</hi> he names ſome beſides himſelfe, that is, <hi>I,</hi> and <hi>you Corinthians, all</hi> beleivers, or at leaſt thoſe that are <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent</hi> Beleivers, if not at <hi>all</hi> times, yet at <hi>ſome</hi> time, if not at every time for the <hi>particular,</hi> yet for the <hi>generall. We know that when this earthly houſe of this Tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, there is a Houſe made without hands reſerved in the Heavens.</hi> He ſpeakes of the tranſlation from the Houſes of <hi>Clay,</hi> theſe bodies that we carry about us, to thoſe Houſes that are cloathed on with <hi>immortality.</hi> God hath provided a houſe, and we <hi>know</hi> it, and are <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured</hi> of it. The Apoſtles, and Saints of both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they laid a great deale of their comfort in this <hi>aſſurance,</hi> therefore they gave Teſtimony to it.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:114893:87"/>
                  <p>And ſo the Saints in <hi>all</hi> times, thoſe that had moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the working of Gods grace, the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>first</hi> times, they triumphed much in <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Bazill,</hi> he ſhewes how <hi>aſſurance</hi> of the pardon of ſin and the favour of God may be <hi>had:</hi> He brings one making the Queſtion. O Sir, tell me how I may get it? I will tell you, ſaith he, if there be that ſpirit in you, that was in him that ſaid, <hi>I have hated all wicked wayes,</hi> you have it. For if there be the worke of the ſpirit of God in <hi>crucifying</hi> of ſin, there is certainly before, the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending</hi> grace in the <hi>pardoning</hi> of ſin. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> he moves the queſtion in another manner then <hi>Baſile,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on handling thoſe words <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The ſpirit witneſſeth to our ſpirits,</hi> look, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> after all this, what cauſe will there be of <hi>ambiguity,</hi> of <hi>doubting?</hi> Who is there that can <hi>doubt</hi> when he hath the teſtimony and <hi>witneſſe</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit?</hi> If the <hi>evidence</hi> of the ſpirit ſhew not it ſelfe <hi>alway</hi> in the ſame meaſure, we muſt have recourſe to thoſe evidences that God gives <hi>ſometimes.</hi> And <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> goes on, though before him, and proſecutes the ſame Queſtion, <hi>Quis locus erit ambiguitatis,</hi> &amp;c. What place will there be for <hi>doubting</hi> &amp; <hi>ambiguity,</hi> who can be <hi>ſorrowfull</hi> &amp; <hi>fearfull</hi> after theſe <hi>evidences</hi> it hath pleaſed God to communicate to us? let him ſtandin fear of <hi>death,</hi> that is afraid to goe with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is not <hi>willing</hi> to goe with Chriſt, let him be <hi>unwilling</hi> to goe with Chriſt that knowes not yet that he hath begun to <hi>Reigne</hi> with Chriſt, there is no man can be <hi>doubtfull,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
                  <p>Men, they will not <hi>deny</hi> but this <hi>oertainty</hi> may be <hi>had,</hi> except they be devoyd of all experience of the working of <hi>grace.</hi> Therefore upon this weighty Pillar, <hi>Hillarie</hi> layes the Foundation of <hi>juſtifying</hi> faith, how ſhall <hi>faith juſtifie,</hi> if faith be <hi>doubtfull?</hi> He ſpeakes not of faith in <hi>every</hi> particular, but of the <hi>certainty</hi> of faith in the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:114893:88"/>if there may not be a <hi>certainty</hi> in the generall, how ſhall it <hi>juſtifie?</hi> I will add that place onely of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> where he ſolaceth himſelfe, by gathering together all thoſe grounds, and evidences of <hi>certainty</hi> God hath <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,</hi> he hath <hi>ſpoken</hi> nay he hath <hi>ſworne, Hoc eſt promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> &amp;c. This is that that God hath <hi>ſealed</hi> with his word, nay, with his Oath, that now there ſhould be no place left to the Children of God, to make any <hi>doubt</hi> of Gods goodneſſe in the <hi>pardon</hi> of their ſins, when they have thoſe evidences of <hi>Sealing</hi> it by the fruit.</p>
                  <p>We ſee it here, not onely by the conſent of the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but of the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>after times,</hi> that <hi>certainty</hi> may be had, and that the comfort of a mans Conſcience doth much conſiſt in this <hi>certainty.</hi> Though <hi>faith</hi> in the time of Temptation will hold beyond the <hi>evidence</hi> of theſe things, and though it be not <hi>alwayes</hi> to be had, yet it <hi>may</hi> be had, there is a <hi>certainty,</hi> and it is much comfort. Therefore Chriſtians will pray ſtill, when they have had <hi>Experience</hi> of the ſweetneſſe of Gods grace, all that they pray for, is, the <hi>enlargement</hi> of their <hi>evidence.</hi> They pray that he would <hi>give peace,</hi> and that he would <hi>ſpeake</hi> it; that he would give <hi>Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>earnest</hi> of Salvation; that he would give the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and the <hi>earneſt</hi> of it. Here is the ſecond thing they pray for. Firſt, that God would <hi>pardon,</hi> and then make it <hi>evident</hi> that he had <hi>pardoned</hi> in the <hi>continuance</hi> of his <hi>grace.</hi> That is the ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as begging the <hi>enlargment</hi> of the <hi>evidence</hi> of the thing; ſo begging <hi>enlargment</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> of grace, ſo the order is juſtifiable. For in putting theſe two together, they pray for theſe two things, for the <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> and for the <hi>removing</hi> of <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> So the order ſtands good: For <hi>ſin</hi> is firſt to be prayed againſt, before <hi>puniſhment:</hi> and the firſt ſuite
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:114893:88"/>that we are to make to God, is for <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> and then for removing of <hi>Judgment;</hi> and this method the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet teacheth them, <hi>Take away our ſins</hi> that <hi>preſſe</hi> us, and thy <hi>hand</hi> that <hi>preſſeth</hi> us; <hi>pardon</hi> us, and <hi>ſpare</hi> us, <hi>remove</hi> thy wrath in <hi>pardoning</hi> our ſins, and then ſhew thy ſelfe <hi>gracious</hi> in removing thy <hi>judgments.</hi> So the Point is this: that,
<q>A true Saint of God, though he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with calamities, and feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and judgements on every ſide, yet that is not it that takes up his firſt thoughts, they are taken up for the removing of his ſins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There he makes his <hi>firſt</hi> Prayer, there he ſtates the <hi>fervency</hi> of his ſoul; becauſe he knows the ſting of <hi>ſin</hi> is <hi>ſharper</hi> a great deale, then the ſting of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and that the <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of God is more heavie then any <hi>judgement.</hi> There is no judgement that is a judgement, if the <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of God goe not with it: For when Gods <hi>love</hi> goes with it, it is a <hi>Chaſtiſement,</hi> and not a <hi>judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we compare <hi>ſpiritualls</hi> with <hi>ſpiritualls,</hi> then we ſhall ſee it plaine and evident. The flame of ſin ſcorcheth more, then the very flames of <hi>Hell,</hi> and more galls the Conſciences. And the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> is not ſo terrible as the diſpleaſure of God. Againe, the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> is not ſo <hi>terrible,</hi> as the having of <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, is <hi>comfortable; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery</hi> is not ſo <hi>evill,</hi> as the <hi>enjoying</hi> of God is <hi>good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:114893:89"/>
                  <p>But if we compare <hi>ſpiritualls,</hi> and <hi>temporalls,</hi> then the diſproportion will eaſily be ſeene? There is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betweene <hi>temporall</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall</hi> mercies: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Children of God pray for <hi>ſpiritualls</hi> before <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, there is no proportion betweene <hi>temporall,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall judgements,</hi> therefore they pray againſt <hi>ſpiritualls</hi> judgements <hi>ſtrſt.</hi> Firſt, againſt <hi>ſin, Take away iniquity and then receive us to favour.</hi> Here is the order, and <hi>method</hi> that Chriſtians ſet in Prayer. <hi>Firſt,</hi> they looke to <hi>ſpiritualls,</hi> to pray for them, to ſpirituall <hi>evills,</hi> to pray againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Though Chriſt in the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> have taught us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother method; firſt to pray for <hi>Daily bread,</hi> and then for <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin. He did it to condeſcend to our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to draw us to the conſideration of that that is <hi>leſſe</hi> knowne, by that that is <hi>better</hi> known. We ſee our <hi>dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread,</hi> and the want of <hi>temporalls</hi> is diſcovered to us by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> therefore theſe things are more <hi>familiar,</hi> and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne, but the weight of <hi>ſin</hi> we know by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the inward man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is not ſo <hi>well</hi> knowne; therefore, that he might give us incouragement to reſt on him for all eſtates, he would firſt draw us on, <hi>Give us our daily bread, and then forgiue us our treſpaſſes.</hi> Not that there is more neceſſity of the <hi>former,</hi> but he condeſcends to lead us from the <hi>leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> to the <hi>greater,</hi> and from the experience of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in <hi>temporalls,</hi> to reſt on him for <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the former is better.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, this is one true <hi>triall,</hi> a part of that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone whereby a Chriſtian may examine himſelfe, and the truth of his <hi>grace,</hi> if it beget indignation againſt <hi>ſin,</hi> that he prayes againſt that firſt; that he find <hi>ſin</hi> more <hi>burthen</hi> then <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> more <hi>ſweet</hi> then all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114893:89"/>
                     <hi>temporalls</hi> in the World. For even <hi>wicked</hi> men will goe ſo far as to cry out of <hi>judgement,</hi> then <hi>Ahab</hi> will <hi>humble</hi> himſelfe, O, but a <hi>godly</hi> man, a beleiving ſoule cries out of <hi>ſin.</hi> My <hi>puniſhment</hi> is greater then I can beare, that was the voyce of <hi>Caine.</hi> My <hi>ſin</hi> is greater then I can <hi>beare, Mine iniquities are gone over my head, and are as a heavy burthen,</hi> that was the voice of holy <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, it is lawfull, and God allowes us to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>temporall</hi> puniſhments, and judgements, but we muſt keepe the <hi>due</hi> order. It is a prepoſterous courſe to pray againſt that <hi>firſt,</hi> before we pray for the <hi>pardon</hi> and removing of <hi>ſin,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſin</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He that would have <hi>judgement</hi> removed, muſt ſtrike at the <hi>Roote,</hi> the <hi>roote</hi> is <hi>ſin,</hi> from that bitter <hi>roote</hi> it is, that <hi>puniſhment</hi> ſprings: cut up the <hi>roote,</hi> and the Tree will not ſtand long. If the <hi>wound</hi> be once <hi>healed,</hi> the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> of puniſhment will fall <hi>off</hi> of it ſelfe. If <hi>ſin</hi> be taken away by <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>turning</hi> to the Lord, then there is no ſuch <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt the <hi>plague</hi> as the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, then whatſoever the <hi>puniſhment</hi> is, it will drop <hi>off</hi> of it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>It is not onely <hi>prepoſterous,</hi> but <hi>ſacrilegious</hi> to obſerve that <hi>method,</hi> when we pray more for the removall of <hi>temporall</hi> judgements, then for <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, it is a ſigne that we <hi>love</hi> our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and <hi>feare</hi> for our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and not <hi>God,</hi> becauſe we hate the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> that is <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> to us, more then <hi>ſinne</hi> that is diſpleaſing to <hi>God.</hi> If we reſt on God for the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, our affections will be ſuitable; to <hi>hate</hi> that <hi>moſt</hi> that God <hi>hates,</hi> that is <hi>ſin:</hi> and if we <hi>hate</hi> it, we need not be intreated in the firſt place to pray for the <hi>removall</hi> of it. Yet many of us are ſo ſenſible of theſe outward things, that we continue in a <hi>prepoſterous</hi> courſe, we more feare the <hi>ſhaddow</hi> of <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> then the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>puniſhment</hi> is more
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114893:90"/>terrible a great deale to us then the commiſſion of <hi>ſin.</hi> We tremble if we doe but heare the report of <hi>one judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet we are not afraid to goe on in a <hi>multitude</hi> of <hi>ſins.</hi> Like diſtempered Patients that hate their <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and love their <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> we love the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> yet we hate that <hi>Phyſick</hi> that God ſends to <hi>cure</hi> us.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, we have not <hi>ſo learned Chriſt;</hi> if the ſtamp of Chriſt be ſet on our hearts, here a Chriſtian bends his forces. Piety keeps due <hi>order, devotion</hi> will in all the Prayers it makes. There is no <hi>affection,</hi> no <hi>word,</hi> no <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculation</hi> that a godly man would willingly have out of order; he looks to all within him, he will not have his <hi>joy</hi> out of order, to beſtow his <hi>joy,</hi> firſt upon the <hi>World,</hi> and then upon <hi>God;</hi> nor his <hi>ſorrow</hi> out of order, to beſtow it firſt upon <hi>temporall</hi> callamities, and then upon ſin; nor his <hi>feare</hi> out of order, firſt on <hi>judgements,</hi> and then on <hi>God.</hi> No, but he ſets all his affections <hi>right.</hi> Firſt, he <hi>feares</hi> God, and the firſt fruits of his <hi>ſorrow</hi> he beſtowes on ſin.</p>
                  <p>It is true, now indeed we begin to be ſencible of the hand of <hi>judgement</hi> that preſſeth us, O let us remember that there is a greater <hi>burthen</hi> lies upon us, that muſt be removed: The Arrows of <hi>ſin</hi> are more ſharp then the <hi>Arrow</hi> of the <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> and if we pull off the head of the Arrow of ſin, the other ſhall be put up in the Quiver. It is true, now the Arrow is pointed neare us: God hath his marke, and as thoſe that are ſkillfull in that kind, they ſhoot, ſometimes <hi>nearer,</hi> ſometimes <hi>further,</hi> as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> ſhot, when he gave warning to <hi>David;</hi> ſo God ſhoots to give us warning, he comes <hi>nearer</hi> in the Mark he propounds, he moves neere by <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and by <hi>Streets,</hi> and then nearer by <hi>Houſes.</hi> Puniſhment is neare, but ſin is nearer, we carry it about us, we muſt make ſin far off, before <hi>puniſhment,</hi> that is the order the Prophet
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:114893:90"/>teacheth them to keepe. Firſt, to Pray for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of ſin, and then of <hi>puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So I have done with the Petition. <hi>Take away all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and receive us graciouſly.</hi> The <hi>parts,</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of the parts.</p>
                  <p>I now come to the laſt part, that is, the <hi>promiſſory</hi> part of the Text.</p>
                  <q>So will we give thee the Calves of our Lips.</q>
                  <p>In the former part, the Prophet excites them to <hi>get Lips,</hi> and here to <hi>give lips;</hi> there it is, <hi>Take to you words,</hi> here, <hi>powre</hi> out your words. <hi>So we will give the Calves of our Lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are 3. things I will obſerve in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the duty the Prophet excites them to here, that they make this <hi>vow</hi> and <hi>promiſe</hi> of, to God, it is the duty of <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>thankfullneſſe, So will we give thee the Calves of our lips.</hi> That is, ſo will we <hi>bleſſe</hi> thee, and <hi>magnifie</hi> thy name, and <hi>ſing</hi> to thy glory, we will ſpeake of thy <hi>praiſe</hi> all the day long.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>metaphor</hi> under which this duty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, <hi>We will give thee the Calves of our lips,</hi> why he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that phraſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>connexion,</hi> and <hi>coherence</hi> with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>So will we give thee.</hi> A man would thinke it were an ill condition, and a duty that were miſplaced, would they not give the Calves of their Lips to God, except he would take away their iniquity, and remove his <hi>judgements?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt thing, which I will onely ſpeake of now, is this, to find out what is the <hi>duty</hi> (that is plaine of it ſelfe) to which he excites them in theſe words. <hi>So</hi> I will read it thus in the litterall ſence, <hi>Take away iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114893:91"/>ſo we will bleſſe and prayſe thee.</hi> So, there are ſix things the Prophet would put them in mind of, by adding this clauſe.</p>
                  <p>Two things in generall.</p>
                  <p>And foure in <hi>perticular;</hi> all concerning <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The two things in generall, he puts them in mind of, are theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>De vovendo,</hi> of making a <hi>vow</hi> and promiſe to God, <hi>We will give thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>De ſolvendo,</hi> of <hi>paying</hi> that <hi>vow;</hi> he labours to bring them not onely to an <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe,</hi> as due, but to a holy <hi>engagement,</hi> that they will certainly render praiſe for this mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolution,</hi> it is one worke that advanceth every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, every <hi>civill</hi> duty, much more duties that are <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> There is no work that a man goes on chearfully in, except he prepare and fit himſelfe by <hi>reſolution.</hi> Therefore it is, that many Saints of God in Scripture took this courſe, to <hi>bind</hi> themſelves by <hi>vowes</hi> to <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> though there be <hi>bonds</hi> already lie at our doore, the bond of <hi>obedience,</hi> yet when we <hi>vow</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, to walk holily before God, this adds another <hi>vow.</hi> He that <hi>without vows,</hi> tranſgreſſeth the Commandements of God, breaks Gods <hi>word,</hi> but he that tranſgreſſeth <hi>in a vow,</hi> breaks <hi>Gods</hi> word, and his <hi>owne</hi> too. The word that <hi>God</hi> hath given, and the word that <hi>he</hi> hath given. Therfore it is a ſpeciall meanes to keep men in the Pale of obedience, when they hedge themſelves in with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolutions</p>
                  <p>I know Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and he more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly then any other of the Romiſh Writers, is very large and peremptory in declaring that that which is within the compaſſe of <hi>precept,</hi> cannot fall within the compaſſe of a <hi>vow,</hi> that no <hi>neceſſary</hi> duty can fall within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114893:91"/>of a vow. But if there were not <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the Saints in <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of their owne <hi>Writers</hi> are ſufficient evidence againſt it, beſides the truth it ſelf, <hi>Alphonſus, Picus, Cajetane, Valencia,</hi> theſe foure they are bold all of them to expreſſe themſelves to be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion; that <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> that that we are <hi>tied</hi> to, by the neceſſity of <hi>precept,</hi> moſt <hi>properly</hi> falls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of <hi>a vow,</hi> and it is moſt ſafe; for one may ſafely <hi>vow,</hi> that that he is <hi>tied</hi> to doe, and the <hi>vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>reſolving</hi> of it, adds a <hi>ſecond</hi> obligation, it is an awaking. Therefore <hi>David</hi> took this courſe, he bound himſelfe by <hi>vow,</hi> and <hi>promiſe,</hi> and <hi>oath. I have ſworne that I will performe thy righteous judgements.</hi> He <hi>excites</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by theſe <hi>Obligations,</hi> to every duty of piety, he ſet himſelfe thoſe Leſſons of <hi>piety,</hi> he taſked himſelfe to ſuch duties; ſometimes to <hi>repentance. To thee will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.</hi> Sometimes to <hi>obedience, I will walke in thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> Sometimes to <hi>prayer, At morning, noone, and evening, I will call on thee.</hi> Sometimes to <hi>thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Seaven times in a day I will prayſe thee.</hi> He taſked himſelfe to theſe duties, thereby to keep, and <hi>hidge</hi> in his <hi>obedience.</hi> So will every Chriſtian, that he may keep himſelfe in the <hi>path</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> he will oft conſider how he walks, and conſider his <hi>purpoſes</hi> and <hi>reſolutions,</hi> and ſtrengthen himſelfe in holy <hi>purpoſes,</hi> it is a great meanes to arme our ſelves. A heart will not <hi>eaſily</hi> be overcome with <hi>temptations,</hi> that is armed with good <hi>purpoſes; good purpoſes</hi> incite to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>practiſe,</hi> you take away <hi>perſeverance,</hi> you take away <hi>practiſe</hi> and <hi>performance,</hi> you take away <hi>endeavour,</hi> if you take away <hi>reſolution.</hi> Therefore if you will learne to keepe your ſelves in the wayes of Gods Commandements, learne oft to <hi>reſolve,</hi> to <hi>purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhall tread <hi>awry</hi> when we have done the <hi>beſt,</hi> but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114893:92"/>if there be a good <hi>purpoſe</hi> God takes that for <hi>performance,</hi> if we arme our ſelves with good reſolutions. Let us not take this help from our ſelves, ſince we come ſhort of <hi>performance,</hi> let us have <hi>endeavours,</hi> and <hi>purpoſes.</hi> This the Prophet teacheth them when they come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their thanks, they muſt have purpoſes, <hi>We will give thee.</hi> Thoſe are the two firſt things he minds them of in generall.</p>
                  <p>There are other things he minds them of, in <hi>perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and they are theſe foure.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, That <hi>Thankfullneſſe</hi> is due to God for all his mercies.</p>
                  <p>It is due, by right of <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> becauſe God is <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>owner</hi> of all we have, he is Lord of our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> there is the <hi>Fountaine</hi> of all goodneſſe. Whither ſhould the <hi>ſtreames</hi> run but back to the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> to the <hi>Sea?</hi> ſayth <hi>Bernard,</hi> let the <hi>ſtreames</hi> of <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> run back to the <hi>Head,</hi> they are drawne from <hi>grace,</hi> they come from <hi>God,</hi> the grace of <hi>pardon,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> muſt returne to <hi>God,</hi> the grace of <hi>thankfullneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is by right of <hi>Debt</hi> his, we owe it him; it is a <hi>Debt</hi> to any man that doth us a courteſie, no leſſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall can be made for the <hi>leaſt</hi> good turne then <hi>thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> yet thoſe that they doe, are <hi>ſmall,</hi> and they are <hi>tied</hi> by the bond of <hi>Charity,</hi> and by the Law of <hi>God,</hi> and they ſin if they doe it not: and thoſe that <hi>they</hi> doe, God doth by their hands, he <hi>inclines</hi> them to it. Then, if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a <hi>miſery,</hi> if we be <hi>unthankfull</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> we owe much more of this duty of <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bond, becauſe from him we have <hi>all</hi> mercy, and the <hi>choiſeſt</hi> mercies. What hand ſoever reacheth us a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> God is the <hi>Author,</hi> God gives it. And can we give him any thing <hi>leſſe</hi> then thanks? We can give him nothing elſe. <hi>He gives</hi> it us when we give him <hi>thanks,</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:114893:92"/>and prayſe, we pay him with his owne, we give not his <hi>mercy</hi> back in the <hi>kind,</hi> but vertually in the <hi>ſtrength.</hi> He that gives <hi>glory</hi> to God, he gives the <hi>mercy</hi> back in ſtrength. But we can give <hi>nothing</hi> to God, that he hath not before in a more eminent manner, whether it be <hi>praiſe</hi> or <hi>glory,</hi> or <hi>bleſſing,</hi> or <hi>reverence,</hi> or <hi>worſhip.</hi> His <hi>name is glorious,</hi> though we give it <hi>not;</hi> his name is <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,</hi> he will make his <hi>glory</hi> appeare, though we <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour</hi> him. But he ſo <hi>interprets</hi> it in mercy, we are ſayd to <hi>give</hi> it, when we <hi>acknowledge</hi> it. He is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of our <hi>gift,</hi> but when we <hi>teſtifie</hi> that he hath it, we are ſaid to <hi>give</hi> it. The <hi>Knee</hi> when it <hi>bowes</hi> before him, <hi>worſhips</hi> him, and the <hi>heart</hi> when it is <hi>raviſhed</hi> with admiration gives him <hi>reverence,</hi> and the <hi>tongue</hi> when it ſpeakes of his <hi>prayſe,</hi> gives him <hi>thankfullneſſe;</hi> if God take theſe as <hi>gifts</hi> at our hands, that we <hi>owe,</hi> and can add no <hi>addition</hi> by it, we can doe no <hi>leſſe</hi> then acknowledge that <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> is <hi>due</hi> to God for all his <hi>mercies.</hi> That is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond thing, he would teach them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> is eſpecially <hi>due</hi> for the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin: when ſin is pardoned, the <hi>firſt</hi> bud of new righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in the heart, O, it is <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> to God. <hi>Bleſs the Lord O my ſoule, and all that is within me;</hi> and then followes, <hi>That forgiveth all thine iniquities.</hi> We <hi>owe</hi> God <hi>praiſe,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> for <hi>all</hi> his <hi>mercy,</hi> and goodneſſe, but for <hi>none</hi> more then the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin; for here is the <hi>Stock</hi> upon which <hi>other</hi> graces are <hi>grafted,</hi> when once ſin is <hi>pardoned,</hi> all <hi>temporall</hi> things prove <hi>comfortable.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they beg for the Pardon of ſin, ſay they, <hi>We will give thee the Calves of our lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> due to God, eſpecially for <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> mercies, and of them, for the grace of <hi>reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> of ſins. A Chriſtian will be <hi>methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:114893:93"/>in his <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> as well as in his <hi>Prayer.</hi> I ſhewed before that <hi>devotion</hi> keeps good order, it prayes for <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualls</hi> before <hi>temporalls,</hi> and againſt <hi>ſpiritualls</hi> before <hi>temporalls.</hi> And <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> keeps a good <hi>order,</hi> it gives thanks for the <hi>beſt</hi> mercies <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>moſt.</hi> Though <hi>all</hi> the mercies of God be good, yet there is a <hi>difference,</hi> there is a difference betweene <hi>ſpirituall mercies,</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</hi> For <hi>temporall</hi> mercies. <hi>Liberty</hi> is better then <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> then <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> then <hi>all.</hi> As <hi>God</hi> hath ſet an <hi>order</hi> in mercies, ſo <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> obſerves an <hi>order;</hi> he doth not <hi>thanke</hi> God ſo much for <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> mercies, as for <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, that <hi>ſwallowes</hi> up the heart, and takes up the whole latitude of the <hi>affections.</hi> There is <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> due for eſtabliſhing us in our <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> Callings, but more for <hi>calling</hi> us to the <hi>acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth.</hi> There is <hi>bleſſing</hi> due for keeping us in <hi>this</hi> World, but more for the <hi>hope</hi> of life in <hi>another</hi> world. <hi>Many</hi> thanks are due for <hi>Creation,</hi> but <hi>more</hi> for <hi>redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> for in <hi>Creating</hi> us, he made us <hi>once,</hi> but in <hi>redeeming</hi> us, he made us <hi>againe,</hi> and in giving us the <hi>hope</hi> of life <hi>everlaſting,</hi> he makes us for <hi>ever.</hi> There is <hi>great</hi> thanks due for removing <hi>temporall</hi> Plagues, but <hi>more</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of his <hi>wrath</hi> and our <hi>ſins.</hi> Therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would have them underſtand, that as they <hi>prayed,</hi> firſt, <hi>Take away iniquity,</hi> ſo they ſhould give <hi>thanks</hi> in that order, when their iniquities were <hi>taken away,</hi> then they ſhould <hi>thanke</hi> God for the <hi>pardon</hi> of their ſins: firſt for <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> then for <hi>temporalls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhews this order; for in our Prayers we Pray for <hi>temporall</hi> things with <hi>conditions,</hi> but for <hi>ſpiritualls</hi> without <hi>conditions,</hi> as we <hi>pray</hi> for them more <hi>fervently,</hi> ſo we ſhould be <hi>thankfull</hi> for them with more <hi>enlarged</hi> hearts. So in <hi>taking away</hi> temporall things, we give <hi>thanks</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> did, but in <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things, we give <hi>thanks</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:114893:93"/>when God <hi>gives</hi> them, but none gives <hi>thanks</hi> for the <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> them away.</p>
                  <p>It is true, when God <hi>with-holds</hi> grace, he can make grace grow out of that <hi>ſeparation</hi> from himſelfe, but that is by <hi>accident,</hi> that the <hi>want</hi> of grace ſhould be a meanes of the <hi>propagating</hi> of grace, but <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> none can <hi>rejoyce</hi> in the taking <hi>away</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> We give <hi>thanks</hi> for <hi>temporalls,</hi> when we <hi>want</hi> them, but for <hi>ſpiritualls</hi> onely, when we have them. That is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another thing he would inſtruct them in, by adding this clauſe, is this, that <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> muſt be joyned with Prayer: firſt, he teacheth them to <hi>pray, Take away iniquity,</hi> but he cloſeth the Prayer with <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe.</hi> Theſe muſt goe together, they are <hi>Siſter</hi>-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and in a large ſence ſpeaking, <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> is a part of <hi>Prayer;</hi> therefore as Prayer inlargeth it ſelfe in expreſſing of wants, ſo <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> in expreſſing it ſelfe in Gods <hi>goodneſſe.</hi> It is a defect we find in the <hi>Miſſalls</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, where we find many <hi>Prayers</hi> made to <hi>Saints,</hi> but not one forme of <hi>thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> If it be lawfull to <hi>pray</hi> to them, it is lawfull to <hi>thanke</hi> them for favours received by them. What a groſſe error is it in them, to make <hi>Prayers,</hi> and not to <hi>thanke</hi> them? Thoſe are more rare, they ſet them at the end of their Books. <hi>Glory and praiſe be to the Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> but for the particular, ſince they make ſo many <hi>Prayers</hi> to the Saints, why doe they not <hi>thanke</hi> them? As in the one, they are <hi>injurious</hi> to God in praying to <hi>Saints:</hi> ſo in the other they are <hi>injurious</hi> to the <hi>Saints,</hi> in not <hi>thanking</hi> them, for ſo many mercies they receive, for the rule is firme, whom we pray to, we muſt give <hi>thanks</hi> to: for the mercies we may <hi>pray,</hi> we may give <hi>thanks.</hi> As <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſpread himſelfe upon the Child,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114893:94"/>
                     <hi>hand</hi> upon <hi>hand,</hi> and <hi>face</hi> upon <hi>face,</hi> ſo in theſe two du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the <hi>hands</hi> muſt be ſpread to God, and <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>eyes</hi> muſt be fixed and faſtened on God in giving <hi>thanks</hi> when we <hi>receive</hi> mercies, as they are fixed in <hi>begging,</hi> and the hands muſt be ſpread as <hi>wide</hi> in <hi>bleſſing</hi> God, as ever they were in <hi>praying</hi> to him, and the <hi>Knees</hi> muſt bow as <hi>low,</hi> and the <hi>voyce</hi> of the lips muſt be lifted as <hi>loud</hi> in giving <hi>thanks</hi> for mercies, as ever they were <hi>extended</hi> in <hi>praying</hi> for mercies. It is a ſigne of an <hi>ungratefull</hi> heart, to be <hi>fervent</hi> in begging mercies, and to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull</hi> of <hi>thankfullneſſe.</hi> Therefore the Prophet bids them joyne <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> to <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is the third thing he minds them of, that <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe</hi> is <hi>due</hi> for <hi>all</hi> mercies, and for ſpirituall mercies, and that <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> muſt goe along with <hi>prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fourth is this, that <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> is to be the <hi>cloſe</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> here the Prayer ends. <hi>So will we give thee the Calves of our lips. Prayer</hi> is one of thoſe duties that I ſaid had a <hi>Language,</hi> there are two Letters that make up the Language: <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of ſin, that is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> to God, that is the <hi>Omega</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>All Prayer opens with <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin, all Prayer ſhuts with <hi>thankſgiving;</hi> that is the <hi>end</hi> of Prayer. Prayer it ſelfe is the <hi>Key</hi> that <hi>opens</hi> to <hi>all</hi> duty, and <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> is the <hi>Key</hi> that <hi>locks</hi> up <hi>prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O! How ſweet will the order be obſerved, when <hi>Prayer</hi> makes the <hi>Way,</hi> and <hi>Thankfullneſſe</hi> cloſeth it; Where theſe <hi>two</hi> are <hi>joyned,</hi> when a man is converſant in that worke, be it <hi>Morning,</hi> or <hi>Evening</hi> Sacrifice, <hi>both</hi> Sacrifices meet in this; in <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of ſin there is the <hi>Dawning</hi> of the DAY, and in giving <hi>Thanks</hi> there is the <hi>Evening</hi> Sacrifice, the <hi>Latter</hi> end, and <hi>Cloſe</hi> of Prayer.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:114893:94"/>
                  <p>Chriſt taught us <hi>this</hi> in the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> after he had ſet downe ſix Petitions: <hi>For thine is the Kingdome, the Powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and the glory,</hi> to ſhew that <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt be <hi>ſhut up</hi> with <hi>thanksgiving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes it, in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>Texhort that Prayers, and Supplications be made for all, with thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> In <hi>Phillipians</hi> 4. <hi>Therefore let your Suites and Requeſts in all things, be made knowne to God by Prayer, and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and giving of thanks.</hi> In <hi>both</hi> places giving of <hi>thanks</hi> comes in the <hi>laſt</hi> place. <hi>With Prayer, and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and giving of Thanks.</hi> Why doth he ſet it in the <hi>laſt</hi> place? To ſhew, that <hi>thanksgiving</hi> muſt <hi>cloſe</hi> up <hi>Prayer. So will we give the Calves of our lips.</hi> That is the fourth thing.</p>
                  <p>And how well doe <hi>all</hi> theſe, if they be put together concurr in the <hi>preparation</hi> we are to make this day for the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> Looke back to the firſt point delivered, and ſee if there be not a concurrence of all theſe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the three enlargements of the <hi>order</hi> of them, remember theſe ſix things, in joyning theſe to them. <hi>So will we render the Calves of our lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we come here, we <hi>pray</hi> to God for his <hi>grace,</hi> and for the <hi>continuance</hi> and <hi>enlargement</hi> of his grace, therefore it is that he inſtituted the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that it might be an inſtrument for the <hi>confirming</hi> and <hi>convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> it is the inſtrument that God uſeth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is, that diverſe of the Fathers are bold to call it, the <hi>preſervative</hi> againſt everlaſting <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> to everlaſting <hi>life;</hi> the <hi>ſalve</hi> of <hi>imortallity.</hi> We come here to <hi>beg</hi> grace, and the <hi>continuance</hi> of it, we come to <hi>beg</hi> grace, and the <hi>evidence</hi> of grace too, by the <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> and <hi>aſſuring</hi> of it: For that purpoſe the <hi>Sacrament</hi> was inſtituted to <hi>confirme</hi> our faith, that we might not want a memoriall of all thoſe great things that Chriſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:114893:95"/>wrought for us. In this reſpect the Fathers call the Lords Supper, the <hi>pledge</hi> of <hi>eternity,</hi> the <hi>defence</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>hope</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> becauſe here grace is <hi>enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> it pleaſeth God to <hi>enlarge</hi> and <hi>confirme</hi> it this way. For thoſe that want <hi>certainty,</hi> here they may get <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> thoſe that have it may get an addition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here we <hi>beg</hi> pardon of ſin, and we give <hi>thanks</hi> for it, and we come to have that ſure to us, and make <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of it, by <hi>thankfullneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, here we acknowledge <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> to God for <hi>mercies,</hi> and make new <hi>purpoſes,</hi> and <hi>reſolutions</hi> of <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,,</hi> we arme our ſelues with new <hi>vowes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this calls all thoſe notions back to your mind, that I delivered before. It is called therefore the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>all</hi> Gods mercies, are here <hi>ſummed</hi> up in the <hi>memoriall</hi> of them, in this bleſſed <hi>Sacrament.</hi> And here we give God thanks, not for <hi>one</hi> mercy, but for <hi>all,</hi> and for the <hi>Fountaine</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of all. Therefore the Apoſtle calls it, the <hi>Cup of bleſſing:</hi> that is, the Cup of <hi>Thankfullneſſe.</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour gave that ground to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> for you know that he did <hi>breake</hi> the <hi>bread</hi> with giving of <hi>Thanks;</hi> to ſhew to us, ſayth <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> how we ſhould <hi>carry</hi> our ſelves, how we ſhould behave and demeane our ſelves in receiving theſe bleſſed myſteries, how we ſhould receive theſe <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries</hi> from the hand of that gracious <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> that <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> of mercy, that gives them with <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them <hi>ſo</hi> as Chriſt gave them: he gave them with <hi>thankfullneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here we have occaſion of excitement for <hi>bleſſing</hi> God for the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, and of bleſſing God, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for giving not onely <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>with</hi> us, but to <hi>die</hi> for us, and not onely <hi>ſo,</hi> but giving us this <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall</hi> of it, in which is the ſumming up of <hi>all mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:114893:95"/>
                  <p>So you ſee here is the <hi>ſumming</hi> up of <hi>all.</hi> Therefore let us joyne all theſe together, and when we come to the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> remember this Prayer. <hi>Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly, ſo will we render the Calves of our Lips.</hi> So much of the firſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: We looke upon the duty of <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe,</hi> as it is ſet downe in <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> termes.

But for the work of <hi>prayſe,</hi> and <hi>thankſgiving,</hi> to be ſet out under the metaphor of the <hi>Calves</hi> of the <hi>lips;</hi> it may ſeeme at the firſt view, a metaphor <hi>far fetched,</hi> but that there is no <hi>title</hi> in the Word of God, but that it is added upon ſpeciall worth, and <hi>reaſon.</hi> Therefore it will be worth our labour, as before I ſhewed the <hi>nature</hi> of the duty of <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> as farr as it concernes the <hi>literall</hi> part, ſo now to look upon it, in the Glaſſe of this <hi>metaphor.

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:114893:97"/>
                  <p>Firſt, what the <hi>Duty</hi> is, that the Prophet aimes at, to which he would <hi>excite</hi> them, when he adds this to the former Prayer. <hi>Take away iniquity, and receive us graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſo will we give the Calves of our lips.</hi> That is, ſo will we <hi>bleſſe,</hi> and <hi>praiſe,</hi> and <hi>magnifie</hi> thy name. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>this</hi> acception, I ſpake of it in the Fore-noone, I told you this duty was added, the memoriall of it, to commend to them the remembrance of ſomewhat in <hi>generall:</hi> to mind them,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>De vovendo.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>De ſolvendo.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Of the Vowing, of <hi>Thankfullneſſe.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Of the Payment, of <hi>Thankfullneſſe.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The prophet hereby would engage them, he makes them to give a pledge, a <hi>Hoſtage</hi> to God, that if <hi>he</hi> would be gracious to them, they would not be <hi>unmindfull</hi> of their Covenant againe, but returne <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>thanks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The things he would remember them of in <hi>perticular,</hi> are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That <hi>Thankfullneſſe</hi> is <hi>due</hi> to God for all his mercies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is <hi>due</hi> to God, eſpecially for <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> mercies, for <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin. <hi>Take away iniquity, and then we will praiſe thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that <hi>thanks</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> muſt goe <hi>hand</hi> in <hi>hand</hi> together. There is no <hi>Prayer</hi> that we offer to God that muſt exclude <hi>Thankfullneſſe.</hi> Firſt he teacheth them to <hi>pray, Take away iniquity;</hi> and then to add, ſo will we give thee <hi>prayſe</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Laſtly, that <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> is the beſt <hi>cloſe</hi> of <hi>Prayer. Prayer</hi> is that that <hi>opens</hi> to all other duties, and <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> is that that <hi>ſhuts</hi> up prayer. Theſe were
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114893:98"/>the things obſerved in the firſt part in the Forenoone.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſecond thing that I conſidered in it, was to look upon this duty of <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> as it is expreſſed in this <hi>metaphor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the third place to come to the <hi>connexion,</hi> in this Particle, <hi>So,</hi> or <hi>Then.</hi> Theſe are the two things I am now to ſpeake of.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is to looke upon the <hi>metaphor:</hi> for there is a great deale of matter couched in that if I miſtake not my ſelfe. Therefore I will examine it in theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>What is the <hi>ground,</hi> the <hi>foundation,</hi> upon which this <hi>metaphor</hi> is pitched, that he ſhould rather chooſe <hi>this,</hi> then any <hi>other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, what is the <hi>reaſon</hi> why the Prophet rather expreſſeth the duty of <hi>Thankfullneſſe</hi> in a <hi>metaphor,</hi> then in <hi>literall</hi> termes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, what are the <hi>grounds,</hi> upon which this <hi>metaphor</hi> is built, or whence is it <hi>derived? The Calves of our lips.</hi> There are two words, it might have beene <hi>varied</hi> either way. For the firſt, <hi>Boves &amp; capras,</hi> the <hi>Goats,</hi> or the <hi>Lambs</hi> of our <hi>lips;</hi> no, it is the <hi>Calves</hi> of our lips. And for the ſecond word, it is not the <hi>Calves</hi> of our <hi>Stalls,</hi> but of our <hi>ſelves:</hi> and in our <hi>ſelves,</hi> not the Calves of our <hi>hearts.</hi> A man would have thought that that ſhould have carried the <hi>ſway,</hi> and turned the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; no, the Calves of our <hi>lips.</hi> There are reaſons as I conceive, to be given of all this.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, for the firſt word, why he inſtanceth in this <hi>creature,</hi> rather then any <hi>other,</hi> for there were <hi>other</hi> Creatures that were offered in <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> The <hi>Turtles</hi> of our lips, or the <hi>Lambs</hi> of our lips. What doe we think ſhould be the <hi>reaſon</hi> why he makes choyce of <hi>this</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which if we compare <hi>Creature</hi> with <hi>Creature,</hi> ſeems
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114893:98"/>the moſt <hi>groſſe</hi> of all other to expreſs the duty of <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe?</hi> We cannot ſay, it was onely in alluſion to <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> for <hi>other</hi> Creatures were uſed in Sacrifice, as well as <hi>Calves</hi> and <hi>Heifers.</hi> We cannot ſay, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>this</hi> Creature was a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So it was. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. when the <hi>Prodigall</hi> came home to his Father, who is every <hi>penitent</hi> ſinner, and the <hi>Father</hi> there is our <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> Father, that <hi>receives</hi> ſinners when they come to him. And there it is ſaid for his entertainment, that he made ready the <hi>Fatted Calfe,</hi> and <hi>Garments,</hi> and <hi>Rings:</hi> theſe are to explaine to us the <hi>fruits</hi> of Chriſts <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of himſelfe, and the Garment of his <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> put upon us. As <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> well ſayth, the <hi>Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Calfe</hi> is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Sacrificed for our ſins. Therefore compared to the <hi>Calfe, Quia immaculatus, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe he gave himſelfe a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>redemption</hi> for ſin. And the <hi>Fatted</hi> Calfe, becauſe of the <hi>excellency</hi> of his Merit, and the <hi>All-ſufficiency</hi> of it. Yet this is not a ſufficient reaſon, for though Chriſt were typified in the <hi>Calfe,</hi> he was ſo in the <hi>Lamb,</hi> it is ſo expreſt by <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World.</hi> Therefore if that were the onely reaſon, becauſe it was a <hi>Type</hi> of Chriſt, it ſhould run as well the <hi>Lambs</hi> of our lips, as the <hi>Calves</hi> of our lips: therefore I conceive, this <hi>reaſon</hi> may <hi>further</hi> be added. There is never a tittle of this Prayer, that the Prophet compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the People, but was well <hi>pondered</hi> in the Ballance of his ſpirit; and as I ſhewed in the reſt, that he brought them to ſome conſideration in every tittle, and word, ſo he would bring them to <hi>conſideration</hi> by <hi>this</hi> phraſe. In <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. the People of Iſraell are compared to an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed Heifer.</hi> In <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. they are called <hi>a Backſliding Heifer.</hi> Their <hi>rebellions</hi> were ſo <hi>great,</hi> that they are ſet downe by this <hi>metaphor,</hi> even Iſraell was an untamed <hi>Calfe,</hi> or <hi>Heifer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:114893:99"/>
                  <p>Further, <hi>this</hi> Creature that they are compared to for their <hi>rebellions,</hi> it was the Creature whereby they <hi>provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> God in the Deſart, they made a <hi>calfe,</hi> and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it. After in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> time, there were 2. ſet up, one in <hi>Dan,</hi> and another in <hi>Bethell,</hi> and they worſhipped them, and now in the Prophets time, they <hi>ſaid to the works of their hands, yee are our Gods.</hi> It is likely thoſe <hi>Creatures</hi> continued in the <hi>ſame</hi> reſemblance. <hi>They turned the ſimilitude of God, to the likeneſſe of a Creature that eateth hay.</hi> By this phraſe it is likely the Prophet would bring them to the conſideration of their ſins. <hi>Take away iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and receive us graciouſly, ſo will we render the Calves of our lips.</hi> As it is obſerved of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Sacrificed to the <hi>true</hi> God, thoſe that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> made their <hi>Gods.</hi> The Prophet would have them ſacrifice <hi>themſelves</hi> to God in that <hi>reſemblance,</hi> whereby the Spirit of God, had ſet out their <hi>rebellion.</hi> As if they had ſayed, we confeſſe we have <hi>rebelled</hi> from the womb, as an untamed <hi>Heifer,</hi> we have dealt <hi>unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Covenant;</hi> we have made to our ſelves <hi>Gods</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> we will now bring our <hi>ſelves</hi> under the yoak, not onely our <hi>necks,</hi> but our <hi>lips</hi> alſo. We will offer our <hi>ſelves</hi> in that very <hi>reſemblance,</hi> whereby we have <hi>diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd</hi> thee. In that <hi>creature</hi> we have <hi>diſhonour'd</hi> thy name and in that very <hi>reſemblance,</hi> for the acknowledgement of our ſins we come to thee. <hi>So will we render the Calves of our lips.</hi> Yet, there is ſomwhat more in it, why he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not onely in this <hi>creature,</hi> but in this condition of the <hi>creature. The Calves of our lips,</hi> it's not <hi>Ox</hi> or <hi>Heifer.</hi> It may ſeem this, they were <hi>novices</hi> in Religion, <hi>Vitulus</hi> is the firſt part; they were not <hi>acquainted</hi> to give the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>prais;</hi> now they were brought to the <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> they would give the Sacrifice of <hi>new praiſe.</hi> They were <hi>inured</hi> to <hi>diſhonour</hi> God, now we will ſing <hi>Pſalmes</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:114893:99"/>of <hi>thanks</hi> giving, and <hi>praiſe</hi> thee with ſongs of <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>bleſſing.</hi> Here was a <hi>new</hi> change, it was the <hi>firſt fruits,</hi> the beginning of their <hi>offering,</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> therfore a <hi>calfe.</hi> It was not onely a <hi>new</hi> part, but they acknowledge that this ſacrifice of praiſe was <hi>imperfect,</hi> it was not yet come to any <hi>maturity,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtrength,</hi> &amp; <hi>ripeneſſe,</hi> they did but <hi>bleat</hi> out praiſes yet, they could not come to ſing <hi>ſongs</hi> of praiſe that were <hi>perfectly</hi> ſet, as other of the Saints had done <hi>before.</hi> We cannot give thee a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> acceptable for <hi>perſection,</hi> but as well as we can, we give thee a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that thou art pleaſed to accept for the preſent, there is the <hi>Calves of our lips:</hi> that is the firſt, <hi>why Calves?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly Why the Calves of the <hi>lips?</hi> There is a <hi>double</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, why not the Calves of our <hi>heards?</hi> Why not the calves that we take out of our <hi>Stalls?</hi> But the calves of our <hi>lips?</hi> I conceive why the Prophet ſets it in this order; there are theſe three reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he would draw them hereby from all opinion of the <hi>

                        </gap>pas oceratum,</hi> of their Sacrifice: they were too prone to think <hi>well</hi> of their <hi>ſacrifice:</hi> therfore hereby by turning the word with this metaphoricall, <hi>the Calves of our lips,</hi> he would draw them to conſider that God was not delighted with the offring of the <hi>ſacrifices</hi> they gave, if they kept <hi>back</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>themſelves.</hi> The Sacrifices that God expected was <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>obedience, ſpirituall</hi> Sacrifices, that they ſhould not make their boaſt what <hi>Hecatombs</hi> they had offred, how many <hi>Calves</hi> or <hi>Lambs,</hi> theſe God <hi>delights</hi> not in, he expreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>I will take no Bullocks out of thy houſe.</hi> He cares not for their <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> if they withdraw <hi>themſelves;</hi> no, he expects a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> I wil not take it out of thy <hi>houſe</hi> but out of <hi>thy heart,</hi> not out of thy <hi>fold,</hi> but out of thy <hi>ſelf.</hi> The prophet would <hi>hereby</hi> lead them to this <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> that they <hi>ſhould</hi> give <hi>ſpirituall ſacrifice,</hi> and look in their <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:114893:100"/>Sacrifice to that that was <hi>morall,</hi> that God expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. The Sacrifice that God looked for, was <hi>praiſe,</hi> the <hi>lips</hi> to be the <hi>offering,</hi> the <hi>tongue</hi> the <hi>knife,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> the <hi>Altar;</hi> both the Prieſt that offered the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Altar,</hi> all, God would have from <hi>themſelves.</hi> That is the firſt reaſon why the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth not, the Calves of the <hi>Stalls: David</hi> ſayth in one place, <hi>Then will we offer young Bullocks upon thine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;</hi> no, ſayth the Prophet, the young Bullocks of our <hi>lips.</hi> That is one thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another thing, why it is not ſaid the Calves of our <hi>ſtalls,</hi> but the Calves of our <hi>lips,</hi> it was for their incouragement that they might not be <hi>backward</hi> in returning, and making retaliation to God. It is not a <hi>coſtly,</hi> ſumptuous <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that God expects. There is nothing more cheap then <hi>words,</hi> and words of <hi>praiſe,</hi> that come from a <hi>ſincere</hi> heart, theſe God calls for. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath <hi>words</hi> ready, it is a Sacrifice as <hi>eaſie,</hi> as the moving of the <hi>lips;</hi> he would not <hi>burthen</hi> them; I require it not out of thy <hi>Houſe,</hi> or out of thy <hi>Fold;</hi> they need not goe to <hi>Arabia</hi> for <hi>Spices,</hi> they need not goe as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant, to the <hi>Field</hi> for a <hi>Calfe;</hi> no, they had it in <hi>themſelves,</hi> there was the <hi>fruit of the lips,</hi> the fruit of <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>praiſe,</hi> within themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Had it beene propounded ſo, it is likely that <hi>Worldly</hi> men would have beene ready to have kept <hi>back.</hi> As many of us, we are readier to give God the <hi>Calves of our lips,</hi> then of our <hi>Stalls;</hi> we love not to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God, of that that <hi>coſts</hi> us ſomewhat, it ſhould be the leaſt and the worſt, if we were to make choyce of it. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would prevent them here, in their <hi>Worldly</hi> mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, that no man ſhould have <hi>excuſe:</hi> the <hi>Poore</hi> man could not plead, I have not <hi>wherewith</hi> to offer, he ſhews that God accepts any thing that comes from a <hi>good</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:114893:100"/>heart; the <hi>Widdowes myte,</hi> the <hi>cup of cold water,</hi> the <hi>words,</hi> the Sacrifice of <hi>praiſe.</hi> As <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> ſometimes when he ſet Lawes to the People of <hi>Sparta,</hi> whereby they ſhould Worſhip their falſe Gods, and they were <hi>poore, cheape</hi> Sacrifices, and one aſking him the reaſon why? Sayth he, that there may never be a <hi>Ceſſation.</hi> If I ſhould charge them with <hi>coſtly</hi> Sacrifices, they would not <hi>continue</hi> to Sacrifice. So God, becauſe he would not <hi>overcharge</hi> them with Sacrifices, he ſeeing the Worldlineſſe of their minds, he ſayth, not the <hi>Calves</hi> of your <hi>Folds,</hi> but the <hi>Calves</hi> of your <hi>lips.</hi> That is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Prophet would ſhew hereby that God expects the <hi>choyſe</hi> Sacrifice of <hi>praiſe,</hi> the moſt <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> Sacrifice, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth well, <hi>Vitulus</hi> was the Calfe that was reputed an <hi>unſpotted</hi> Sacrifice. To ſhew that he that comes to praiſe God muſt bring <hi>pure, cleane,</hi> and <hi>undefiled lips.</hi> He that <hi>regards iniquity in his heart,</hi> or brings it in his <hi>lips,</hi> he offers the <hi>Calves</hi> of his <hi>lips,</hi> but God will not be <hi>pleaſed</hi> with a Sacrifice from <hi>that</hi> mans mouth, whoſe <hi>mouth</hi> is <hi>polluted</hi> with <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe,</hi> and <hi>obſcene</hi> Language. A <hi>prophane</hi> man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God with the Calves of his <hi>lips,</hi> he hath <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous</hi> lips. The lips that are given to <hi>filthineſſe,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give God a Sacrifice, they are <hi>polluted.</hi> The lips that are given to <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>fraud,</hi> they cannot give God a Sacrifice they are <hi>deceitfull</hi> lips. They are <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>chaſt</hi> lips, that muſt be Sacrificed to God: Our <hi>lips</hi> muſt be of the ſame <hi>die,</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> with our <hi>hearts, ſincere hearts,</hi> and <hi>ſincere lips, holy affections</hi> God looks for, and <hi>holy words,</hi> and <hi>holy breathings.</hi> That is the third thing, he calls them the <hi>Calves of the lips,</hi> that is, <hi>choyce,</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>lips.</hi> He would have <hi>ſuch</hi> lips as he would have <hi>Calves</hi> upon the <hi>Altar,</hi> he would not have <hi>Calves</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:114893:101"/>that were <hi>lame</hi> &amp; <hi>defiled;</hi> ſo, bring ſuch <hi>lips</hi> as are <hi>acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with the <hi>praiſe</hi> of God; theſe are the lips that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. Againe, there is ſomewhat further, why not the Calves of our <hi>hearts,</hi> which is the <hi>cheife</hi> thing in all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but the Calves of our <hi>lips?</hi> The <hi>lips,</hi> if the heart be abſent, are not <hi>acceptable</hi> to God; he abhors the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> that is given with the <hi>lips,</hi> when the <hi>heart</hi> blaſphemes him, and the <hi>life</hi> prophanes him. A man would thinke it were better, we will give thee the Calves of our <hi>lives,</hi> then of our <hi>lips,</hi> or at leaſt of our <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> and <hi>hearts.</hi> For <hi>David</hi> ſets out the Sacrifice of God ſo, to be a <hi>humble,</hi> broken <hi>heart.</hi> It is the <hi>heart</hi> that God looks to, in all theſe, it is neither the <hi>eyes</hi> lift up in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or the hands ſpread, or the <hi>Knee</hi> bowing, that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted to God, if the <hi>heart</hi> be wanting; the heart is the life of all theſe. <hi>Out of the abundance of the mouth, the heart ſpeaketh,</hi> and out of the abundance of the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>mouth</hi> ſpeaketh, and the <hi>eyes</hi> are lifted up, and the <hi>Knees</hi> bow, and if there be an <hi>Abſence</hi> of that, nothing is <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> but the <hi>lips</hi> themſelves are <hi>abhominable,</hi> yet he ſaith, the <hi>Calves</hi> of our <hi>lips.</hi> There are two reaſons of that.</p>
                  <p>One is this, though he mention not the <hi>heart,</hi> yet the <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> he need not mention it, it was taken in, <hi>The Calves of our lips,</hi> that is, of ſuch <hi>lips</hi> as proceed from a cleane, pure, honeſt <hi>heart,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>taken</hi> in, it is therefore not expreſt. That was a thing to be <hi>ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> that if they gave the <hi>outward</hi> man, they would give the <hi>inward:</hi> but the Prophet calls them here, becauſe of their negligence in the <hi>expreſſion</hi> of their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe in the <hi>Outwaod</hi> man. To ſhew them, That though <hi>mentall</hi> praiſe be the chiefe thing that God looks to, when the heart is there, yet it is not the <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> thing; God will not onely be glorified in the <hi>ſoule,</hi> but in the <hi>body,</hi> he will not onely have the praiſe of the <hi>heart,</hi> but of the <hi>lips.</hi> We think to put off God, if we
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114893:101"/>ſend up an <hi>Ejaculation,</hi> and give God a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it is all within. The Hypocrite is all for <hi>without,</hi> and the <hi>timerous</hi> Chriſtian is all <hi>within:</hi> though he <hi>bow</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Baal,</hi> yet if he give God his <hi>heart,</hi> he thinks it is a good Sacrifice. But God will have praiſe both of the <hi>inward</hi> man, and of the <hi>outward</hi> man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>made both,</hi> he <hi>ſanctifies both,</hi> and will <hi>ſave both;</hi> he calls them therefore to <hi>vocall</hi> praiſe, with the <hi>Calves</hi> of their <hi>lips:</hi> they were growne ſo, that they knew not how to doe this, therefore ſayth <hi>David, I will praiſe thee with a ſong, and magnifie thy name with unfeigned lips.</hi> God looks for <hi>vocall</hi> praiſe, as well as <hi>mentall,</hi> we muſt as well Praiſe him with our <hi>Lips,</hi> as with our <hi>Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>included,</hi> for the <hi>Calves of our lips</hi> is the Sacrifice of our <hi>ſelves:</hi> he that gives <hi>God</hi> a gift, muſt give the <hi>whole,</hi> the <hi>lips</hi> are put for the <hi>whole,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>expreſſe</hi> the <hi>whole,</hi> therefore he inſtanceth in <hi>this</hi> part, that is put for the <hi>whole</hi> man. It is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſets downe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that you offer your ſelves a living Sacrifice to God, which is your reaſonable ſerving of him.</hi> Then a man gives <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> when he gives the Strength of the <hi>faculties</hi> of his <hi>mind,</hi> and of the <hi>parts</hi> of his <hi>body,</hi> when he gives the glory of <hi>all</hi> his <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>intentions,</hi> when he learnes to <hi>deny himſelfe.</hi> He that Sacrificeth, he <hi>parts</hi> with that which he Sacrificeth; and he that Sacrificeth <hi>himſelfe, parts</hi> with himſelfe, and <hi>denies</hi> himſelfe. <hi>He that will come after me let him denie himſelfe.</hi> A man that gives <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> in ſacrifice, goes <hi>out</hi> of <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and keeps <hi>nothing</hi> back, when a man brings carnall reaſon, and opens his <hi>affections,</hi> and will, to be <hi>Subject</hi> to God, when he brings all thoſe <hi>ſins</hi> which he was <hi>addicted</hi> to by <hi>nature,</hi> or hath <hi>contracted</hi> by <hi>cuſtome,</hi> when he brings all <hi>to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> and layes them upon the <hi>Altar</hi> of a <hi>penitent,</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:114893:102"/>contrite <hi>heart,</hi> ſuch a man offers <hi>himſelfe</hi> to God. It is a thing moſt <hi>precious</hi> with <hi>men</hi> themſelves, and it is a thing moſt <hi>precious</hi> with God too. There is nothing of that <hi>value,</hi> that we can give to God, as our <hi>ſelves,</hi> he that gives his <hi>whole ſelfe,</hi> gives all the duties that can be performed by <hi>man:</hi> He gives the Sacrifice of <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> are Dedicated to God in works of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> his <hi>eyes</hi> in <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> in <hi>repentance,</hi> every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of his <hi>mind,</hi> all his <hi>whole ſelfe</hi> is conſecrated to God. That is to make a true devotion ſayth St. <hi>Auſtin, O ſi quis bene, &amp;c.</hi> If any man will make a <hi>perfect vow,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God, let him make a dedication of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Hoc eſt quod debetur, imago,</hi> this is that that <hi>God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> this is that that <hi>we owe,</hi> the Image of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the Image of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> God made man for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> therefore we ſhould give our <hi>ſelves.</hi> See how farr we doe it, Chriſt he gave not any thing of <hi>himſelfe,</hi> but <hi>himſelfe</hi> for us, his <hi>whole ſelfe,</hi> we muſt make ſuch a retalliation to give to God againe, not any thing of <hi>ours,</hi> but <hi>our ſelves,</hi> that God requires. If we give any thing to the <hi>World,</hi> we give not our <hi>ſelves</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> if any thing to the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> if any thing of our <hi>ſelves</hi> to our <hi>ſelves,</hi> we give not our <hi>ſelves</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> The way to <hi>keepe</hi> our <hi>ſelves,</hi> is to <hi>give</hi> our <hi>ſelves</hi> to God. A man never <hi>keeps himſelfe</hi> till he <hi>looſe himſelfe,</hi> then he is kept ſure when he is laid in <hi>Gods</hi> armes. The <hi>preſumptuous</hi> man gives not <hi>himſelfe</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> he gives not God his <hi>feare.</hi> The <hi>doubtfull,</hi> diſpairing Chriſtian, he gives not himſelfe to God, he gives not God his <hi>hope.</hi> The <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> man gives the <hi>World</hi> his <hi>deſire,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> hath his <hi>love,</hi> and his <hi>joy.</hi> He that conſecrates himſelfe to <hi>ſin,</hi> let him ſee to whom he gives <hi>himſelfe,</hi> not to <hi>God,</hi> who is one hat abhors <hi>iniquity,</hi> and tranſgreſſion: You know who was the <hi>firſt</hi> author of ſin; he that dedicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114893:102"/>to <hi>ſin,</hi> gives himſelfe to him that is the <hi>Author</hi> of it, I abhor to name it, to whom we conſecrate our ſelves, Chriſtians Baptiſe themſelves into the name of <hi>Satan,</hi> they give themſelves in Sacrifice to the <hi>Devill:</hi> To conſecrate our ſelves to <hi>ſin,</hi> is to doe ſo, it is plaine, the Prophet puts not in the <hi>heart</hi> here, becauſe the whole man is included; therefore he ſayth not, We will give thee the <hi>Calves</hi> of our <hi>hearts,</hi> but <hi>We will give thee the Calves of our lips.</hi> This for the meaning of it.</p>
                  <p>Now look in the ſecond place, why the Prophet makes <hi>choiſe</hi> of it, for there was a large Field of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that he could have uſed. <hi>David</hi> hath this work ſet downe in much <hi>variety</hi> of Language, ſo we will <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>glorifie</hi> thee, and give <hi>laud</hi> to thy name, ſo will we <hi>ſing to thy praiſe,</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> thee in our actions, any of theſe would have ſerved, yet he chooſeth this, we will give the Sacrifice of our <hi>ſelves.</hi> The reaſons that make it full, for the underſtanding of it, are theſe three, why he paſſeth by <hi>literall</hi> phraſes, and expreſſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in a <hi>Metaphoricall, So will we render the Calves of our lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, to ſhew them, and to teach to us, that <hi>thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> and <hi>praiſe,</hi> is a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Every duty of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in which a man conſecrates himſelfe to God, is called a Sacrifice. <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is a <hi>Sacrifice, Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Offer to God the Sacrifice of righteouſneſſe. Prayer,</hi> that is a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> or oblation. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. <hi>Let my Prayer be as incenſe.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſayth, Chriſt <hi>offered up Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the dayes of his fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>repentance</hi> is a Sacrifice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>The Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of God is a humble contrite heart.</hi> It is not onely <hi>one</hi> Sacrifice, but <hi>the</hi> Sacrifice, the <hi>eminent</hi> Sacrifice that God delights in, a <hi>humble</hi> heart.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Almes</hi>-deeds, that is a Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.

                     <hi>To doe good, and diſtribute forget not; for with ſuch Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice God is well pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>praiſe</hi> is called a Sacrifice, <hi>By him,</hi> that is, by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>let us offer the Sacrifice of praiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>thankſgiving,</hi> that is a Sacrifice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. and diverſe others. <hi>I will offer the Sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay my vowes to the Lord.</hi> Nay, and the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. he ſets downe <hi>all</hi> Chriſtian duties under this metaphor, we are made <hi>a holy Prieſthood,</hi> in <hi>him</hi> we ſhould <hi>offer</hi> the duties of Chriſtianity there ſet downe, to make an oblation of them; they are <hi>every</hi> duty cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there, a Sacrifice or oblation. The Prophet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would draw them to this Conſideration, that whereas they were much buſied and imployed in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>legall</hi> Sacrifices, that they would look to the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> Sacrifices. Here are the Sacrifices that are <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi> the other <hi>vaniſh,</hi> theſe <hi>continue</hi> under Chriſtianity: And theſe are not onely not <hi>taken away,</hi> but <hi>perfected</hi> in the time of the Goſpell. The <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Sacrifices are Sacrifices that <hi>continue</hi> ſtill: but they are <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ones that we offer to God. <hi>Every</hi> Chriſtian duty is as a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> nay, as a ſeverall Sacrifice. We may paralell it, <hi>Repentance</hi> is as a <hi>Treſpaſſe-offring; Zeale</hi> is as a <hi>Burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring,</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> is as a <hi>Free-will-offring:</hi> and <hi>thank full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that is as the offring of the <hi>firſt-fruits.</hi> He that brings <hi>ſincerity</hi> to God, there is the oblation of <hi>unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> bread. The Apoſtle ſets it out 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>The unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread of ſincerity.</hi> He that honours God in the works of <hi>Charity,</hi> gives the two young <hi>Turtles,</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> are as <hi>Turtles; mercy</hi> is as the young <hi>turtles</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God. I might inſtance in other perticulars. The <hi>incenſe</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>praiſe,</hi> here the <hi>Lamb</hi> of a <hi>humble</hi> heart. There is no Chriſtian <hi>duty</hi> but hath ſome proportion to ſome <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> it is that in <hi>truth,</hi> and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114893:103"/>that the Sacrifice <hi>typified.</hi> Therefore the Prophet to draw them from looking on their Sacrifices with a <hi>carnall</hi> eye, he inſtanceth in this, to teach them that <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> duty, and in particular, the duty of <hi>praiſe</hi> is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God. That is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he would not onely teach them that <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe</hi> was a Sacrifice, but that it was a <hi>better</hi> Sacrifice, as I ſhewed out of the Scriptures, that it is reputed a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> ſo I ſhall ſhew out of the ſame Scriptures, that it is a <hi>better</hi> Sacrifice, every one of them. For <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> ſayth <hi>Solomon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o doe judgement is more acceptable then Sacrifice: righteouſneſſe</hi> is a better Sacrifice. For <hi>mercy,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> tells us, <hi>I deſire mercy, and not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and the works of <hi>piety</hi> more then <hi>Burnt offrings. Mercy</hi> is there preferred before <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> For <hi>obedience, Samuel</hi> tells us in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. <hi>I will have obedience, and not Sacrifice, and the knowledge of God is more then the fat of Rams.</hi> There is the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>God</hi> more then <hi>Burnt offrings, more</hi> then the <hi>fat of Rams,</hi> that is, it is better. For <hi>repentance, David</hi> ſayth, <hi>Thou delighteſt not in burnt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings, thou deſireſt not Sacrifice, elſe would I give it thee, thou delighteſt not in Burnt offrings.</hi> Then followes, <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of God is a contrite heart,</hi> it is <hi>farr</hi> beyond <hi>Burnt</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for the duty of <hi>thank fullneſſe,</hi> the Pſalmiſt ſayth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. there it is plaine, that the work of <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe</hi> is more acceptable to God, it is <hi>better</hi> then <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I will praiſe the name of the Lord with a ſong, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him with thanksgiving: this alſo ſhall pleaſe the Lord better then a Bullock that hath hornes, and hoofs.</hi> The <hi>Calves</hi> of their <hi>Stall,</hi> and of their Fold, were not ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, as the <hi>praiſing</hi> of God with <hi>Songs,</hi> the Sacrifice of <hi>thanksgiving.</hi> The Prophet would teach them this, that <hi>thank fullneſſe</hi> was not onely a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but a better <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:114893:104"/>
                  <p>The uſe I will make of this, is that that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> makes of it. Let all the <hi>Jews</hi> give eare to this, their <hi>legall</hi> Sacrifices are <hi>vaniſhed,</hi> they are not able to ſtand before the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Sacrifices; all the Sacrifices of <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> are better. The reaſons are weighty.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he that offers a <hi>Bullock,</hi> offers ſomewhat <hi>out</hi> of <hi>himſelfe,</hi> he that gives <hi>obedience,</hi> gives <hi>himſelfe,</hi> ſayth <hi>Gregory,</hi> in the Sacrifice, there is the fleſh of <hi>Beaſts</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but in obedience, and in <hi>praiſe,</hi> there is our <hi>owne will,</hi> our owne <hi>rebellious</hi> will, the <hi>untamed</hi> Heifer of our owne ſtubborne <hi>hearts,</hi> they are offered to God. It is <hi>better</hi> in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is better in this reſpect alſo, all thoſe that they offered in the time of the Law, they were <hi>dead</hi> Sacrifices, if we ſpeake according to the <hi>Letter,</hi> and <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> according to the <hi>inſtitution.</hi> They were alwaies to <hi>vaniſh,</hi> they were alwaies <hi>Mortalia,</hi> now they are <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fera;</hi> they were <hi>to die</hi> in time, and now they are <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> then they were <hi>abrogable,</hi> now they are <hi>abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</hi> But he that offers duties of <hi>piety,</hi> gives God a <hi>living</hi> Sacrifice, he that offers <hi>himſelfe. I beſeech you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren give up your ſelves a holy living Sacrifice, Rom.</hi> 12. There is a great deale of <hi>odds,</hi> therefore let the <hi>Jews</hi> give eare to this, God looks not to the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but it is the <hi>Offerers</hi> that God looks to, not to the <hi>Offering,</hi> not to the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that is offered. It is recorded by ſome Interpreters, that there is no place of Scripture that the <hi>Jews</hi> miſtake, more then this that I have in hand. For they hold that this part of the Prophecy was a <hi>predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> not onely of the <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> captivity, the miſery that did befall them then, but of their <hi>diſperſion,</hi> that doth befall them <hi>now,</hi> and hath continued ever ſince the time of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe now they are in this great miſery of their <hi>diſperſion,</hi> they hold this to be the meaning of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114893:104"/>place, <hi>We will give the Calves of our lips;</hi> when they meet in their <hi>Synagogues</hi> to this day; they read alwayes the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and perticularly thoſe <hi>rytes</hi> of <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> and becauſe they have not a Temple now to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in, they read the <hi>Law;</hi> and they think that God accepts that for a ful offering of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> becauſe of this, <hi>We will give the Calves of our lips,</hi> becauſe they read the <hi>rytes</hi> of <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> miſtaking this place, that is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prophet for <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Sacrifices. The Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that God accepts, conſiſts not in <hi>reading,</hi> but in <hi>prayſing, Take away iniquity, and we will praiſe thee.</hi> It is not <hi>reading</hi> of <hi>words</hi> of <hi>praiſe,</hi> but <hi>powring</hi> out the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>praiſe,</hi> that God accepts: that is it that <hi>David</hi> calls the Free-will-offering of his mouth. Therefore to convince the <hi>Jews,</hi> that their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> ſhould end in time, the Prophet ſhews by this, that they ſhould be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated.</hi> They <hi>boaſt</hi> of their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and even now God <hi>accepts ſpirituall</hi> Sacrifices, far <hi>beyond</hi> them, and in <hi>time</hi> he will not <hi>look</hi> on them at <hi>all,</hi> therefore bring God the <hi>Calves</hi> of your lips.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let <hi>Christians</hi> give eare to this, as here is the <hi>Jews conviction,</hi> ſo here is the <hi>Chriſtians inlargement,</hi> the Chriſtians <hi>happineſſe.</hi> Here we ſee the vertue, and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> continues, when the <hi>letter</hi> of the Law is <hi>killed,</hi> the <hi>morallity</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice continues,</hi> though the <hi>ceremony</hi> be taken <hi>away.</hi> Let no man ſay he will not offer <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Sacrifices to God, leſt he ſhould ſeem <hi>judaicall;</hi> nay, we muſt <hi>judaiſe</hi> in this perticular. But how? In a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ſence, we muſt offer God the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>inward</hi> man, theſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Sacrifices, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody,</hi> ſpirituall Sacrifices. Doe not think that we are acceptable to God in <hi>outward</hi> performances, in things of <hi>ceremony,</hi> and things of <hi>rytes,</hi> it is the <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that he looks to, to give him not <hi>unleavened</hi> bread,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114893:105"/>but <hi>ſincerity</hi> and ſimplicity of heart; not <hi>Doves,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, not the <hi>LAMBS</hi> of our <hi>Fold,</hi> but <hi>ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> not the Sacrifice, of <hi>Beaſts,</hi> but of <hi>obedience.</hi> God expects not the <hi>dividing</hi> of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> but of our <hi>hearts.</hi> In a word, not the <hi>Calves</hi> of our <hi>Folds,</hi> but of <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> that is the <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon why the Prophet inſtanceth in this phraſe. He would teach them; Firſt, that <hi>thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> is a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Secondly, that it is a <hi>better</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is another reaſon yet, he would teach them that thanksgiving is a daily Sacrifice by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, <hi>The Calves of the lips.</hi> For <hi>Calves</hi> were ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as were taken in to <hi>all</hi> kind of <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> At the <hi>Conſecration</hi> of their <hi>Prieſts, Exod.</hi> 29. they offered <hi>Calves,</hi> for the <hi>Burnt-offering</hi> this Creature was taken in, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. This Creature was taken in for the <hi>Treſpaſſe-offering. Levit.</hi> 4. For the <hi>Peace-offering, Levit.</hi> 9. At the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their <hi>Purification</hi> this Creature was Offered, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. Then put it together, they uſed <hi>daily</hi> to Offer the <hi>Calves</hi> of their <hi>Stalls,</hi> and of their <hi>Folds:</hi> to ſhew them therefore that more frequently they muſt give God <hi>prayſe,</hi> and <hi>thanks,</hi> that it muſt be a <hi>daily</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, he inſtanceth in this, <hi>The Calves of our lips;</hi> to ſhew, that <hi>thanksgiving</hi> muſt be taken in to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> Sacrifices we offer. If a man <hi>humble</hi> his ſoul in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, thankfullneſſe</hi> muſt come in, that God gives him a <hi>heart</hi> to repent. If a man <hi>diſtribute</hi> his goods to the <hi>poore, thank fullneſſe</hi> muſt be taken in, that God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him to give. If a man <hi>pray</hi> to God, <hi>thank full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> muſt goe along, that God hath given him a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of Prayer. In <hi>hearing</hi> of the word, <hi>thankfullneſſe</hi> muſt goe up as a Sacrifice, that God hath given us his <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> if we look upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> upon our <hi>Friends,</hi> upon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114893:105"/>our <hi>lives;</hi> looke <hi>any</hi> way, <hi>before</hi> us, <hi>behind</hi> us, ſtill there is occaſion of <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> becauſe Gods mercies are continued.</p>
                  <p>Thankfullneſſe muſt not onely <hi>daily,</hi> but <hi>howrely,</hi> nay, every <hi>minute</hi> it muſt be offered, it hath that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>other</hi> Sacrifices. We muſt offer <hi>praiſe</hi> when God <hi>preſerves</hi> us, and <hi>delivers</hi> us, and <hi>feeds</hi> us, and <hi>keeps</hi> us, and <hi>cloaths</hi> us; nay, when he <hi>corrects</hi> us; when we <hi>riſe,</hi> when we <hi>lie</hi> downe, when we <hi>eat,</hi> when we <hi>faſt,</hi> when we goe <hi>forth,</hi> when we <hi>returne,</hi> in <hi>every</hi> paſſage of our <hi>lives,</hi> there is occaſion of the Sacrifice of <hi>thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> that as they took in the oblation of <hi>Calves</hi> to <hi>all</hi> kind of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> ſo he would have them take <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe</hi> in <hi>every</hi> duty, when they profeſſed to <hi>turne</hi> to God in <hi>repentance;</hi> when they prayed to God <hi>Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way iniquity,</hi> and we will give thee the <hi>Calves of our lips,</hi> that he might ſtir them up to offer the <hi>daily</hi> Sacrifice of <hi>praiſe.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> makes it a <hi>daily</hi> and <hi>hourely</hi> Sacrifice, <hi>Seaven times a day I will praiſe thee.</hi> That is, <hi>often,</hi> on <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> occaſion, he would excite them to the practiſe of this duty. This is the third reaſon. So much of the phraſe, both the <hi>ground</hi> of it, and the reaſon why the Prophet choſe it.</p>
                  <p>But one word more briefly, and that is of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,</hi> and then I have done with this Text, and ſhall pick out ſome other ſuitable to the times; and there lies a great deale of <hi>weight</hi> in the <hi>connexion. Weake</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings will be too prone to <hi>wreſt</hi> it, <hi>So will we give thee,</hi> Mark it, <hi>Take away iniquity and receive us graciouſly, ſo will we give the Calves of our lips.</hi> That is, <hi>forgive</hi> our <hi>ſins, remove</hi> thy <hi>judgements,</hi> and then we will <hi>prayſe</hi> thee. Shall we think the Prophet taught them to <hi>condition</hi> with God, if thou <hi>wilt</hi> take away our <hi>puniſhment</hi> then we will <hi>praiſe</hi> thee, or elſe <hi>not?</hi> I could recite ſome
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114893:106"/>ſuch Stories out of the blindneſſe of <hi>Popery</hi> (but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are out of the <hi>Legend,</hi> I think them not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the rehearſing) of thoſe that have caſt their <hi>Images</hi> into the <hi>Water,</hi> becauſe they did not keep them from <hi>ſtormes,</hi> ſhall we think that they doe <hi>condition</hi> with God? No, the <hi>pious</hi> heart brings his Sacrifice in his <hi>hand,</hi> if thou wilt <hi>ſave</hi> me, I will <hi>bleſſe</hi> thee, if thou wilt not, I will <hi>bleſſe</hi> thee; though thou <hi>pardon</hi> not our ſins, we will <hi>bleſſe</hi> thee for the <hi>continuance</hi> of our <hi>lives,</hi> what <hi>ever</hi> thou doeſt, we will bleſſe thee. That cannot be the meaning of it. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> preſſeth it well, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, ſayth he, that a Chriſtian ſhould reaſon thus. None of you would take it well at your <hi>Childrens,</hi> or at your <hi>Wives</hi> hands, to <hi>adhere</hi> to you in <hi>proſperity,</hi> and leave you in <hi>adverſity,</hi> to ſay, I will <hi>live</hi> with you in <hi>plenty,</hi> but when <hi>plenty</hi> ceaſeth, then <hi>Farewell.</hi> Sayth <hi>Auſtin</hi> well, look, thou wouldeſt be <hi>loved</hi> of thy <hi>Wife,</hi> though there be no <hi>deſert</hi> in thee, though there be nothing to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade</hi> her, becauſe of the <hi>conjugall</hi> bond, and wouldeſt thou love God, for any thing out of <hi>himſelfe?</hi> For <hi>by</hi>-reſpects? Thou wouldeſt think much if thy <hi>Wife</hi> ſhould <hi>love</hi> thee for <hi>by</hi>-reſpects, and not for thy <hi>ſelfe,</hi> and wilt not thou doe it for <hi>God?</hi> It is like that phraſe where <hi>Jacob</hi> ſeems to <hi>ſtipulate</hi> with God in the ſame nature. <hi>If God will be with me, and bleſſe me in my journey, and give me bread to eat, and cloaths to put on, that I returne to my Fathers houſe in peace, then God ſhall be my God.</hi> Shall we thinke that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſo <hi>humble</hi> a man, would <hi>contract</hi> with God to bring him <hi>home</hi> in <hi>ſafety,</hi> and then he would <hi>ſerve</hi> him, or elſe <hi>not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, oft times the Hebrew Particle is onely a <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi> not a <hi>condition,</hi> and it is thus much, <hi>after,</hi> or <hi>when</hi> God hath brought me home, I will ſerve him <hi>more</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably, and <hi>devoutly,</hi> I will <hi>declare</hi> it to all the World,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114893:106"/>and ſet up <hi>Altars</hi> to his praiſe, then <hi>God ſhall be my God.</hi> So here, <hi>Take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly;</hi> when thou haſt done that, <hi>then</hi> we will <hi>enlarge</hi> our hearts to <hi>powre</hi> out the Sacrifice of <hi>praiſe,</hi> we will <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply</hi> thankſgivings, we will doe it now, yet, though there be cauſe now, <hi>then</hi> there will be more to doe it. So, three wayes it may be juſtified; it hath reſpect to three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as it hath reſpect to that that the People did, ſo it juſtifies the <hi>connexion</hi> of the phraſe. They had <hi>ſinned,</hi> it hath reſpect to that phraſe, <hi>Take away iniquity,</hi> and then we ſhall have <hi>cauſe,</hi> that is not all, but we ſhall have <hi>boldneſſe,</hi> and encouragement to praiſe thee. As if they had ſaid, as long as <hi>ſin</hi> preſſeth us, and our <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi> ſtand in thy preſence, ſo long we cannot bleſſe thee, thou wilt not accept the praiſe of <hi>ſinfull</hi> lips; therefore firſt <hi>remove</hi> our iniquities, that we may give thee a <hi>pure</hi> Sacrifice of praiſe. We dare not <hi>look</hi> up to Heaven now our <hi>ſins</hi> are on us; but <hi>receive us graciouſly,</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> our iniquities, that we may bring thee a <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Sacrifice, then it will be acceptable. So it is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that way, as it hath reſpect to the work of <hi>ſin.</hi> So the Point is this.</p>
                  <q>He that will give a true Sacrifice to God, muſt firſt lay aſide his ſins.</q>
                  <p>There is no oblation of <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> if ſin be in the way; <hi>Praiſe</hi> is not <hi>ſeemly</hi> out of the mouth of a <hi>ſinner,</hi> that is, it is not <hi>acceptable,</hi> it is a <hi>reproofe</hi> to him that <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> it, and a <hi>diſhonour</hi> to him that ſhould <hi>accept</hi> it. It is not <hi>honour</hi> to God to take a Sacrifice from <hi>polluted</hi> lips, thoſe lips that he hath made for <hi>himſelfe.</hi> Therefore he hath made mans <hi>tongue,</hi> his <hi>glory,</hi> when we with one
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:114893:107"/>breath <hi>blaſphemes</hi> that ſacred name, and then <hi>perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> bleſſe him. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not heare my Prayers,</hi> nor accept my <hi>praiſe.</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. he expreſſeth himſelfe ſo, he brings in God <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> a Sinner that <hi>calls</hi> upon his <hi>name,</hi> and doth not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake</hi> his ſins. <hi>What haſt thou to doe to take my name,</hi> or my <hi>word into thy mouth, ſince thou hateſt to be reformed?</hi> It is well obſerved of <hi>Origen,</hi> when he was to make an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore Sermon to the people at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was an Eloquent man, he would ſpeake ſo, he let his Book fall open to chooſe his Text, and it opened upon this place, <hi>What haſt thou to doe to take my words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy mouth;</hi> his heart ſtruck him, becauſe he had put <hi>incenſe</hi> to an <hi>Idoll,</hi> and he ſat downe, and <hi>wept.</hi> His heart ſtruck him, becauſe he knew he was conſcious of the <hi>ſin.</hi> O that our hearts would doe ſo; we come to <hi>heare</hi> the word, and to <hi>Preach,</hi> and to <hi>ſing</hi> to his <hi>praiſe,</hi> and we bring our <hi>ſins</hi> with us, we make obſtacles to the aſcent of our <hi>Prayers</hi> by bringing our <hi>ſins.</hi> O Caſt <hi>away</hi> ſin firſt. If thou come to the Table of the Lord, that is the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> there thou commeſt to offer the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of thankſgiving. If thou come to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of God to offer <hi>Prayer.</hi> If thou come to offer <hi>obedience, attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in hearing the word, caſt away ſin, it will <hi>poyſon</hi> all, it will make the <hi>word</hi> unprofitable, it will make our <hi>Prayers</hi> that they ſhall not aſcend, nor our <hi>praiſes</hi> in a ſpirituall, acceptable vapour into Gods eares. That is the firſt thing. There was a neceſſity that he ſhould put in this phraſe; ſo will we <hi>praiſe</hi> thee, for unleſſe ſin be taken away, it is impoſible to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it hath reſpect to the work of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo to the work of God: there are two things in that.</p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:114893:107"/>
                  <p>To the work of <hi>puniſhment;</hi> and</p>
                  <p>To the work of Gods <hi>grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the work of puniſhment, for all theſe three are in the former, <hi>Take away iniquity,</hi> remove thy <hi>judgement,</hi> and give us <hi>grace,</hi> take away <hi>iniquity,</hi> and then we ſhall <hi>boldly</hi> come to the Throne of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Now, Secondly, remove thy <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and then we will praiſe thee. It hath reſpect to Gods work of <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> Not, as if we ſhould not <hi>praiſe</hi> God, when his hand is upon us. A <hi>good</hi> Servant of God will praiſe God, not onely when he <hi>ſmiles,</hi> but when he <hi>corrects</hi> him, not onely when all is <hi>proſperous,</hi> but in the middeſt of his <hi>callamities</hi> and <hi>ſufferings.</hi> If he <hi>ſhut</hi> him up in his <hi>Houſe,</hi> he will praiſe him; if he makes <hi>all his ſtormes</hi> to riſe againſt him, he will ſtill <hi>bleſſe</hi> him; as <hi>Job,</hi> he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God when he had taken away all, <hi>The Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> But yet there is reaſon of it, take away thy <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> and then we will bleſſe thee: that is, then we ſhall have <hi>opportunity</hi> to bleſſe thee. While thy <hi>hand</hi> is on us, our <hi>hearts</hi> are <hi>dejected: Praiſe</hi> is grafted on a <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> ſpirit; and while our <hi>hearts</hi> are caſt <hi>downe,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>praiſe</hi> thee, thou muſt <hi>enlarge</hi> our hearts by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and then we ſhall have <hi>opportunity</hi> to <hi>bleſſe</hi> thee: that as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſayth, <hi>The living, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> And as <hi>David</hi> ſayth, <hi>Shall thy faithfullneſſe be ſeene in the Grave? Or thy loving kindneſſe in deſtruction?</hi> Wilt thou cut us <hi>off</hi> by <hi>judgements,</hi> and can we <hi>praiſe</hi> thee <hi>then? The dead remember thee not,</hi> if thou <hi>cut</hi> us of by thy <hi>plagues</hi> and <hi>ſtormes,</hi> how ſhall we praiſe thee then? Then our <hi>lips</hi> will be <hi>ſealed</hi> up, and our <hi>hands</hi> will be <hi>benummed.</hi> O take away thy <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and then we ſhall have opportunity to <hi>praiſe</hi> thee. The Point is this.</p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:114893:108"/>
                  <q>The true Child of God, though he will bleſſe God in all eſtates, yet then he is moſt diſpoſed to Praiſe God, when God removes his Hand; when he makes his Rod, not to fall upon him.</q>
                  <p>Becauſe a <hi>dull</hi> dejected <hi>Spirit</hi> is not fit for <hi>praiſe; Praiſe</hi> muſt be grafted upon <hi>joy.</hi> It is a word of Exhortation to thoſe of <hi>dejected</hi> ſpirits, that they chide themſelves out of their <hi>Melancholly</hi> paſſion, ſince they have <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of Gods favour, that they rob not God of <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe.</hi> A man of a <hi>dejected</hi> ſpirit, he thinks God doth all as an <hi>Enemy</hi> for the worſe; he robs God, he cannot <hi>praiſe</hi> him. Labour for a <hi>chearfull</hi> ſpirit, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>praiſe</hi> God, for it is the <hi>elevated</hi> Spirit that <hi>praiſeth</hi> God. Remove thy <hi>judgements,</hi> and then we ſhall have opportunity to praiſe thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, it hath reſpect, not onely to the works of God <hi>without,</hi> but to the work of God <hi>inward,</hi> and ſpirituall, to the work of <hi>grace.</hi> It hath reſpect to the work of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and now to the work of <hi>grace.</hi> So the meaning is this, <hi>Receive us graciouſly,</hi> and then we ſhall have <hi>enablement</hi> to bleſſe thee. See how they hang: firſt, <hi>Take away iniquity,</hi> and then we ſhall have <hi>boldneſſe</hi> to bleſſe thee, remove thy <hi>judgements,</hi> and then we ſhall have <hi>opportunity</hi> to praiſe thee, powre thy <hi>grace</hi> on us, and then we ſhall be <hi>enabled</hi> to praiſe thee. Thou muſt put words of praiſe into our mouths, or elſe we cannot praiſe thee, we can doe <hi>nothing</hi> of our ſelves. Can we give the Calves of our <hi>lips,</hi> unleſſe thou <hi>give</hi> them to us? The Calves of our <hi>heards</hi> we have them from <hi>thee,</hi> but the <hi>Calves</hi> of our <hi>ſelves</hi> are <hi>harder</hi> to give. We would faine <hi>bleſſe</hi> thee, but our <hi>lips</hi> are <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed</hi> lips, they are <hi>tyed,</hi> Lord doe thou <hi>hallow</hi> them, <hi>ſanctifie</hi> them, doe thou give us <hi>words, Take to you words.</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:114893:108"/>Where ſhall we get them? Doe thou open our lips, and thou ſhalt have the <hi>glory</hi> of our <hi>lips,</hi> put the words of <hi>praiſe</hi> into <hi>us,</hi> and then we will <hi>praiſe</hi> the; we ſhall then have <hi>enablement</hi> to praiſe thee. The Point is this:
<q>The Child of God, as he depends on God for acceptance of his Sacrifice of Prayer, and performances; ſo he depends upon God for Enablement, that God may have praiſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no duty of piety, growes upon mans <hi>owne</hi> heart, there muſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God move in the heart. If it be the work of <hi>praiſe</hi> or <hi>Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> they are all fruits of the Spirit; that is, thoſe fruits that flow from the <hi>inhabitation,</hi> and powerfull <hi>operation</hi> of the Spirit of God. They are the fruits of Gods Spirit, that we may all cry, <hi>Not unto us, but unto thy name give the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> the glory of <hi>forgiving</hi> of ſins, the glory of any <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> belongs to <hi>thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſideration of this will excite us to <hi>thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> when we conſider where the <hi>Fountaine</hi> is, whence we draw, that it is above, that it is not our <hi>owne</hi> arme that <hi>ſupports</hi> us, that it is not our owne <hi>Spirit</hi> that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies</hi> us, or our <hi>owne</hi> Spirit that <hi>ſuggeſts</hi> the words of <hi>Prayer,</hi> of <hi>praiſe,</hi> and <hi>thankfullneſſe.</hi> The conſideration of this, will excite us to <hi>Prayer,</hi> as well as to <hi>thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> When we conſider that <hi>every God gift is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſayth of wiſdome. <hi>If any man want wiſdome, let him ask it of God.</hi> It is true of other graces: If any man want <hi>repentance,</hi> let him aſk it of God, if any man want <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> and <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> let him aſk it of God.</p>
                  <p>Here we ſee the way paved out to us, to goe to God for the <hi>beginning</hi> &amp; <hi>enlargement</hi> of all grace whatſoever.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114893:109"/>If any want an <hi>underſtanding</hi> heart, it is God that <hi>enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens</hi> the heart. If any want a <hi>contrite</hi> heart, it is God that <hi>melts</hi> it: If any want a <hi>ſincere</hi> heart, it is God that <hi>ſtrengthens</hi> it: If it be the want of a <hi>zealous</hi> heart, it is God that <hi>enflames</hi> it; if a <hi>humble</hi> heart, it is God that <hi>bows</hi> it; if of a <hi>thank full</hi> heart, it is God that <hi>enlargeth</hi> it: <hi>all</hi> is of <hi>God,</hi> all our <hi>ſufficiency.</hi> Therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet teacheth them, that the grace of <hi>Thankfullneſſe</hi> was not powred out by the ſtrength of their <hi>owne</hi> piety, but they muſt have recourſe to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſumm of all is this, <hi>Take away our iniquities,</hi> and then we will <hi>praiſe</hi> thee. That is, take away our <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and we will give thee the Sacrifice of <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> Take away our iniquity of <hi>cruelty,</hi> and we will give the Sacrifice of <hi>mercy;</hi> take away our iniquity of <hi>falſhood,</hi> and we will give thee the Sacrifice of <hi>truth:</hi> take away our iniquity of <hi>ingratitude,</hi> and we will give thee the Sacrifice of <hi>Thankfullneſſe.</hi> Powre thy <hi>grace</hi> on us, and then we will <hi>bleſſe</hi> thee, and bleſſe thee in a plentifull manner, we will pay thee of thine <hi>owne,</hi> give us <hi>thy grace,</hi> and we will give it <hi>thee</hi> againe. It is <hi>thy</hi> grace, and not <hi>ours,</hi> let it be <hi>thine</hi> in <hi>giving,</hi> and <hi>receiving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Beloved!

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT the ſcope is of theſe words, you will very well underſtand by reading of them. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them is concerning <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> an uſefull argument to be knowne, of what <hi>kind</hi> of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever we ſpeake, though it be the temptation of <hi>Seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> A Chriſtian is no where ſafe, but as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> well, <hi>Temptations</hi> haunt us <hi>daily,</hi> in what <hi>place,</hi> or in what <hi>Action</hi> ſoever we are converſant.</p>
                  <p>If we ſpeake here of the Temptations of <hi>Afflictions,</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:114893:112"/>theſe times will very well call for this Argument. We are now under <hi>Gods</hi> owne <hi>hand,</hi> he hath brought us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a State of <hi>ſuffering,</hi> we had need therefore to furniſh our ſelves every way, becauſe we know not how theſe ſufferings may yet be ſeconded, for they yet continue.</p>
                  <p>It is a <hi>uſefull</hi> Argument, and being ſo uſefull, that is the reaſon that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> here gives it a <hi>full</hi> handling and Explication. And indeed we may call it his <hi>peculiar</hi> argument, for none of the holy Penmen wrote or ſpake ſo <hi>entirely,</hi> or largely of this Argument, as this Apoſtle, which is obſervable in <hi>all</hi> the Apoſtles, that however it is true of <hi>each</hi> of them, what was ſaid of <hi>Tullyes</hi> Oratory, that they were able, being indued with the <hi>Spirit</hi> from above, to ſpeake of <hi>every</hi> point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that doth appertaine unto Salvation, and left none untouched that was neceſſary to be knowne; yet there was none of them but had ſome <hi>particular</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was <hi>peculiar</hi> almoſt to himſelfe, in which he did excell.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> went thorough the whole Doctrine of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet there is one Argument in perticular, that is peculiar to him; the Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> that he handles above the reſt.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>John</hi> hath one Argument that he was <hi>peculiar</hi> in, the Doctrine of <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Jude</hi> of <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Temptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That you may ſee it is his <hi>peculiar</hi> Argument in this narrow compaſſe of words I have read, he name the word at leaſt <hi>ſix</hi> times, he ſets it downe in all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>parts,</hi> he defines <hi>what</hi> it is that is called <hi>Tentation,</hi> he divides it into the ſeverall <hi>Branches.</hi>

                  <p>And all theſe of ſpeciall uſe for Edification.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe when God doth <hi>afflict,</hi> and <hi>correct</hi> us, we are moſt of us too prone to think his hand is heavy on us, and complaine of <hi>hard</hi> uſage to thinke our <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ſharp and <hi>irk ſome,</hi> therefore for this the Apoſtle u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a word of <hi>Support,</hi> and incouragement to eſtabliſh our hearts that we doe not think them <hi>long, bitter,</hi> and <hi>ſharp,</hi> becauſe they are onely ſent for <hi>tryall,</hi> and in the end rewarded with a <hi>Crowne,</hi> and that Crowne, the Crowne of <hi>life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, becauſe we are unacquainted, and <hi>Ignorant</hi> of the dealing of God towards us, and too
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:114893:113"/>prone to charge him <hi>fooliſhly,</hi> as if he were the Author of <hi>ſeducing</hi> temptations, becauſe he is the Author of <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting,</hi> therefore for this end he lends us a word of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> and <hi>anticipation</hi> to keepe us off from entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch conſiderations and thoughts. <hi>Let no man when he is tempted, ſay he is tempted of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, becauſe in both theſe kinds we are too forward to <hi>excuſe</hi> our ſelves, and to put off all the blame from our ſelves with a <hi>Non feci,</hi> or <hi>Non taliter feci,</hi> or <hi>Invitus feci,</hi> either with <hi>Sarah</hi> to <hi>deny,</hi> and ſay I did it <hi>not,</hi> or with <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>excuſe</hi> it, and ſay, the <hi>Serpent</hi> gave me, and <hi>beguiled</hi> me, and I was <hi>foreed</hi> to it; therefore there is for this a word of <hi>information,</hi> to teach us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all to the right <hi>principle,</hi> and to lay the blame, as we doe deſerve, upon our <hi>ſelves. Every man is tempted when he is drawne away of his owne luſt, and enticed.</hi> Here are now the parts.</p>
                  <p>The thing I am now to ſpeake of and begin firſt with is this word of <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>incouragement,</hi> and it may well be called a <hi>Support,</hi> becauſe nothing can more <hi>uphold</hi> a man (either in the <hi>one</hi> kind of temptation or in the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) then to remember the Heavenly <hi>reward,</hi> the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>glory</hi> that is ſtated and aſſured to the <hi>induring</hi> of <hi>tribulation,</hi> therefore with this now I begin with the word of <hi>Support</hi> in theſe words.</p>
                  <q>Bleſſed is the man that indureth temptation, for when he is tryed, he ſhall receive the Crowne of life.</q>
                  <p>And to bring it to a briefe, there are foure <hi>deſcriptions</hi> here laid downe, all which concerne Tribulation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a <hi>deſcription</hi> of the <hi>perſon</hi> to whom the promiſe is made, <hi>The man that indureth temptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then a <hi>deſcription</hi> of the <hi>Reward,</hi> the excellency of the <hi>retribution,</hi> it is <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Crowne of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:114893:113"/>
                  <p>Then the <hi>deſcription</hi> of the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of this Crowne, or <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> thus promiſed, it is the Crowne of life, <hi>that the Lord hath promiſed,</hi> or <hi>aſſured</hi> to <hi>them that love him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the deſcription of the <hi>manner</hi> of the retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>time</hi> when it ſhall be, <hi>when he is tryed,</hi> when he is <hi>fully</hi> tryed, then he ſhall receive the <hi>Crowne of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is the deſcription of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> that is the <hi>Mark</hi> at whom the <hi>Arrowes</hi> of <hi>Temptations</hi> and Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſhot, in whom theſe <hi>Darts</hi> are faſtened, the deſcription of the <hi>Perſon</hi> to whom the <hi>promiſe</hi> is made, the <hi>man</hi> that indureth <hi>Temptation.</hi> There are two words it conſiſts of.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>perſonall</hi> word, <hi>Beatus vir,</hi> bleſſed is the man.</p>
                  <p>And then there is a <hi>paſſive qualification,</hi> it is ſuch a man as <hi>indureth</hi> Temptation.</p>
                  <p>The perſonall word that is the <hi>Subſtratum,</hi> upon which all the reſt depends, and it is very remarkable here, becauſe it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is not <hi>Beatus homo,</hi> but <hi>Beatus vir,</hi> there is a great deale of difference betweene theſe. <hi>Homo</hi> is a word of <hi>nature, Vir</hi> is a <hi>word</hi> that betokeneth <hi>vertue: Homo</hi> ſignifies a man of <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; Vir</hi> a man of <hi>Spirit.</hi> The difference is very obvious, and that you may ſee it diſtinctly, it is received and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in <hi>all</hi> ſorts of Authors. In <hi>prophane</hi> Authors, that of <hi>Plato</hi> will ſerve very well to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever comes neere, and toucheth upon <hi>vertue,</hi> is <hi>Maſculine,</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> gives the reaſon of it, becauſe ſayth he, by <hi>nature</hi> both the <hi>body</hi> and the <hi>mind</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> are ſo framed, as to be better enabled to <hi>indure</hi> labour, and <hi>paine,</hi> and travell and <hi>torment,</hi> then the <hi>weaker</hi> Sex.</p>
                  <p>Then if we look to <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Writers, it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the Fathers. Take that of <hi>Lactantius</hi> for all, he obſerves that <hi>Vir</hi> and <hi>Virtus</hi> come both from the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:114893:114"/>ſame. Therefore it is obſerved in the three <hi>Learned</hi> Languages, that the ſame word ſignifieth <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Manhood,</hi> and <hi>Fontitude,</hi> the ſame word ſignifies to be a <hi>Man,</hi> and to be <hi>Valiant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then if we come to the witneſſe of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> there is frequent uſe of the word to call a <hi>valiant, ſtout, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, zealous</hi> man, indefinitely by the name of a <hi>man, Jer.</hi> 5.1. when God bids them run up and downe the Streets of <hi>Jeruſalem. See if you can find a man.</hi> It is not meant ſimply, if you can find <hi>Hominem,</hi> but <hi>Virum,</hi> a man, a <hi>godly</hi> man, one that <hi>executeth judgement,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> there was a multitude of <hi>hominum,</hi> abundance of <hi>men,</hi> but there was a great <hi>paucity virorum,</hi> of <hi>vertuous</hi> men. It was ſo in the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. joynes them ſweetly, <hi>Quit yourſelves like men, be ſtrong,</hi> to ſhew, that the <hi>Strength,</hi> eſpecially Strength of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and <hi>Fortitude,</hi> is a <hi>Maſculine,</hi> and <hi>manly</hi> vertue, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we bring it to the <hi>Touch-ſtone</hi> of <hi>Tribulation,</hi> and <hi>Temptation. The Spirit of a man,</hi> that is, of a <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> man, is ſeene in nothing more, then in <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during Tribulation.</hi> Therefore that, that the <hi>Comedian</hi> ſayd in another caſe, <hi>Homo homini,</hi> &amp;c. If you alter it, it will ſerve here, <hi>Vir homini.</hi> What is the <hi>difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a <hi>Man</hi> and a <hi>Man?</hi> much every way, there is a <hi>Man</hi> by <hi>nature, Vir ſaeculi,</hi> there is a man by <hi>Grace, Vir dei,</hi> a man of <hi>God,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath it often. <hi>Thou O man of God flee theſe things.</hi> And <hi>that the man of God may be perfect,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. The ſame that is here <hi>indefinitly</hi> by St. <hi>James</hi> called a <hi>Man,</hi> is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>a man of God. Reaſon</hi> defines a <hi>man</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> but <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> defines a <hi>man</hi> in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> he is the <hi>moſt man,</hi> that is the <hi>most Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> St. <hi>Jerome</hi> therefore in <hi>Tribulation</hi> and <hi>Temptation,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the difference very well, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> hath this paſſage, for a <hi>man</hi> not to be <hi>ſenſible</hi> of <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:114893:114"/>and Tribulation, it is <hi>above</hi> the reach, above the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> above a man of <hi>mortality:</hi> but for a man not to <hi>beare</hi> his <hi>affliction,</hi> it is beneath the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a <hi>man,</hi> beneath a <hi>man</hi> that ſhould have <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>fortitude;</hi> for this preſent Argument we may ſo apply it, there is <hi>Proprium hominis &amp; proprium viri,</hi> to <hi>have</hi> Tribulation, is <hi>Proprium hominis,</hi> to <hi>beare</hi> Tribulation with a ſtout courage, that is <hi>Proprium viri,</hi> proper both wayes.</p>
                  <p>It is the <hi>property</hi> of a <hi>man</hi> of <hi>mortality,</hi> to be <hi>ſubject</hi> to <hi>Tribulation,</hi> becauſe our life is a <hi>warfare</hi> full of <hi>feares,</hi> and <hi>ſorrowes,</hi> and <hi>outcries,</hi> and <hi>Tribulations. Man is borne to trouble</hi> (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 5.7. ſpeakes) <hi>as the ſparks fly upward.</hi> It is naturall to a man of <hi>mortality</hi> to be <hi>in Tribulation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there is another <hi>property</hi> withall, <hi>Proprium viri,</hi> the <hi>property</hi> of a <hi>man</hi> that is ſuch by <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> to <hi>indure</hi> Tribulation, to <hi>indure</hi> as a <hi>Man,</hi> that is, as a <hi>Chriſtian. Bleſſed</hi> is the <hi>man,</hi> that is, bleſſed is the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Sex,</hi> not as if it did betoken diſtinction of <hi>Age,</hi> becauſe God did put <hi>Spirit,</hi> and vertue, and <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> into the mouths and hearts of <hi>Babes,</hi> and <hi>Sucklings,</hi> he raiſeth ſuch ſometimes to be <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes) before they have <hi>Age</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> of Sufferings; they have a <hi>Maſculine,</hi> and manly ſpirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to <hi>indure</hi> ſuffering. <hi>Ireneus</hi> gives the reaſon well, Chriſt took the Succeſſion of all <hi>ages</hi> upon him, to Sanctifie <hi>all</hi> ages. <hi>Man-hood</hi> to Sanctifie <hi>Man-hood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi> to Sanctifie it; none is a <hi>Child</hi> that God inabl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not take it, as though he excluded younger yeares from <hi>induring</hi> tentation, and glorifying God that way, he that puts <hi>Prayſe</hi> into the mouth of <hi>Babes,</hi> may put <hi>fortitude;</hi> we muſt not exclude that <hi>Age,</hi> but <hi>any</hi> Age that <hi>indures</hi> temptation is a bleſſed <hi>man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then it notes not a diſtinction of <hi>Sex,</hi> becauſe we read of <hi>feminine</hi> patience of thoſe that were more then <hi>femenine,</hi> of <hi>Agatho,</hi> and <hi>Apollonia,</hi> in the Primitive Church, of the Mother of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Heroick</hi> ſpirits had they?

                  <p>Therefore under this one name, <hi>both Sexes</hi> are meant, becauſe God gets glory to himſelfe both wayes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> moves the Queſtion, and anſwers well upon thoſe words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that hath not walked in the Counſell of the ungodly.</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon makes the Queſtion, <hi>Num quid a conſortio beatitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis excluſit mulieres quia virum ſolum beatum nuncupavit?</hi> Doth he exclude the <hi>other Sex</hi> from the fellowſhip and ſociety of bliſſe and <hi>beatitude,</hi> becauſe he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man?</hi> He anſwers well, God forbid we ſhould have ſuch an Opinion, they are both equally called to grace,

                  </p>
                  <p>It is not a word that betokens diſtinction of <hi>Sex</hi> but it is ſet downe by this word, <hi>bleſſed is the man,</hi> to let us ſee that the <hi>induring</hi> of tribulation requires a <hi>high</hi> courage and a <hi>manly</hi> ſpirit not a <hi>womanniſh</hi> nature, nor as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, he muſt not bee a <hi>young</hi> ſcholler, a <hi>novice</hi> in Chriſtianity that comes once to encounter <hi>temptation,</hi> nothing will ſo much try the ſpirit of a man as perſecution and <hi>tribulation,</hi> of what nature ſoever it be.

                  </p>
                  <p>Admitt it be the temptation of <hi>Tribulation</hi> from God, when a man (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he <hi>fought with beaſts at Epheſus</hi>) is to deale with <hi>vnreaſonable men,</hi> to encounter with <hi>poverty</hi> in eſtate, with <hi>contempt</hi> and deſpite, he had need to plucke <hi>up</hi> his heart, to <hi>double</hi> his ſpirit, to get <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, vertue,</hi> and <hi>grace;</hi> he had need to have the diſtillation of <hi>manhood</hi> to beare tribulation.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible for a man to <hi>beare</hi> tribulation without <hi>vertue,</hi> ſo the heathen could ſay; wee muſt carry it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Vertue</hi> that is <hi>ſpritualized grace, morall</hi> vertue will doe <hi>ſomthing</hi> and hath done much in others; but <hi>grace</hi> is the <hi>forme</hi> of a ſpirituall man the <hi>anima animae</hi> it is of Grace, that <hi>enlivens,</hi> animates, and inables. <hi>Seneca</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <p>Therefore to wind it up, that which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> that was ſometime a King, but after he was diſpoſſeſt of his Kingdome, was addicted much to <hi>Platoes</hi> Philoſophy, that which he anſwered ſeaſonably, when he was put beſides all his glory and pomp, and one ſaid to him; What good hath <hi>Platoes Philoſophy</hi> done you?

                  <p>Much is it with grace, and the Spirit of God, <hi>Grace</hi> it is infinitly better then <hi>Platoes Philoſophy;</hi> beſides all other benefits from <hi>grace,</hi> the <hi>word</hi> of Gods grace, it both ſhews what we are, <hi>Homines,</hi> men of <hi>mortality,</hi> and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth us to be what we ſhould be; <hi>Vir,</hi> men of <hi>vertue,</hi> ſtrong and <hi>ſtout,</hi> prepared for the <hi>enduring</hi> of Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here now is <hi>this</hi> word of the Apoſtle, with an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis</hi> ſet upon it, he ſets it downe <hi>vir,</hi> not <hi>homo, Bleſſed is the man that indureth tentation.</hi> Here is the firſt thing.</p>

                  <p>The next we are to look on, is the <hi>paſſive</hi> qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the man that <hi>endureth temptation,</hi> or <hi>Tribulation; Temptation</hi> is the word, but <hi>tribulation</hi> is the meaning; it is not here to be underſtood of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> temptations, but of <hi>corporall</hi> temptations.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> temptations he ſpeakes afterwards, in the words that follow, but here, of the temptations of <hi>tryall,</hi> not of <hi>ſeduction;</hi> yet the Apoſtle would rather expreſſe it thus, he would uſe this word, he calls <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, temptation,</hi> as ſhewing a holy <hi>Conqueſt</hi> he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of it already, he expreſſeth it by an <hi>eaſy</hi> word, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. he hath one word peculiar to him, that he calls <hi>tribulations,</hi> weakneſſes, <hi>infirmities,</hi> St. <hi>Paul fillips</hi> them off with an <hi>eaſie,</hi> ſlight word, though he ſuffered ſo <hi>much,</hi> they were but <hi>infirmities,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath that word proper to himſelfe, of <hi>infirmities</hi> and weakneſſes; ſo St. <hi>James</hi> hath this word almoſt peculiar to him, to call <hi>Tribulations, temptations</hi> and <hi>tryalls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the temptations of <hi>

                        </gap>ſeduction,</hi> it is not generally true, that there is <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> and happineſſe for the man that <hi>endures</hi> them, a man is not to <hi>endure</hi> them but to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>If they be ſuggeſtions that ariſe <hi>either</hi> as it is a mans <hi>firſt</hi> happineſſe not to <hi>have</hi> them, and his 2. to <hi>overcome</hi> them; ſo it is a mans <hi>firſt miſery</hi> to <hi>have</hi> them, and his 2. miſery to <hi>yeild</hi> unto them. <hi>Thoſe</hi> Temptations are not to be <hi>indured,</hi> but diſdained, and <hi>abhorred,</hi> and caſt out of our hearts, it is not bleſſed is the man that <hi>endures theſe,</hi> but bleſſed is the man that <hi>Suppreſſeth</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>And if we ſpeake of <hi>injected</hi> temptations from Satan, it doth not hold in the <hi>univerſall,</hi> bleſſedneſſe doth not <hi>alway</hi> belong to the enduring of them; it is true, if God ſend <hi>a Meſſenger of Satan to buffet</hi> us, and we doe not <hi>yeild,</hi> he that <hi>endures</hi> patiently, ſhall not want the <hi>Crowne</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114893:117"/>but the firſt care a Chriſtian muſt take it to <hi>reſiſt</hi> theſe, <hi>reſiſt the Devill and he will flee,</hi> if a man out of <hi>faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of Spirit <hi>yeild</hi> to theſe temptations, he brings not a <hi>bleſſing,</hi> but a <hi>curſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So it is not to be underſtood of <hi>thoſe</hi> temptations, there is not <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> to the <hi>enduring</hi> of them, but to the <hi>repelling</hi> of them. But let them goe, becauſe it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood here of the temptations of <hi>troubles,</hi> and <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>chaſtiſements.</hi> It is well they are called <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>two</hi> regards they are called <hi>Temptations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One is in regard of the <hi>good</hi> effect they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. The good effect is this, to be <hi>tryalls</hi> of that <hi>grace,</hi> and vertue, that God hath beſtowed upon us; for all Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation is Gods ſacred <hi>Furnace,</hi> his holy, celeſtiall <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> whereby God takes a tryall of thoſe vertues that are in us, they are ſent for the <hi>proofe</hi> and tryall of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, therefore they are called <hi>Temptations;</hi> becauſe as <hi>temptations</hi> try of what <hi>ſpirit</hi> a man is, whither he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>reſiſt</hi> the ſuggeſtion; ſo <hi>affliction</hi> makes tryall of a man, nothing more proves a mans Spirit of what mettle he is made then Tribulation, when the Sun ſhines <hi>faire,</hi> all is well with us, a little vertue will goe <hi>farr,</hi> but in the houre of <hi>Temptation,</hi> the day of <hi>affliction,</hi> and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement, and tribulation, then it is ſeene what is in man, there needs a <hi>greater</hi> meaſure of grace, and if it be there, it will ſhew it ſelfe. It is called <hi>Temptation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>good</hi> effect it ſhould produce.</p>
                  <p>And then becauſe of the <hi>evill</hi> effect it may produce, there are none of all theſe <hi>Chaſtiſements</hi> that God ſends, but if they be not ſanctified they prove <hi>Temptations, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, paine</hi> of body, <hi>diſgrace</hi> in the World, whatſoever ordinary way men take to eaſe themſelves, ordinarily the effect is, they drive them to <hi>repine,</hi> and <hi>murmur,</hi> to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:114893:118"/>ill meanes of ſupply; a Worldly man is no ſooner af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted but preſently he bethinks himſelfe what way <hi>ſoever</hi> he may get out of Tribulation, thus they may prove <hi>Temptations,</hi> becauſe they may ſometimes <hi>occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Temptations to make men <hi>prophane</hi> the name of God, to make men <hi>deny</hi> God, and diſobey his will, and lead them out of the way of piety, thus they prove <hi>Temptations</hi> if they be not ſanctified, if grace comes not between, <hi>grace</hi> comes between, and keeps them from proving <hi>Temptations,</hi> when they be ſanctified, that we be not ſeduced, therefore they are called Temptations, and the words are uſed equivalently in diverſe places; that that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>rejoycing in Tribulations,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> calls, <hi>rejoycing in temptations. My Brethren account it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great joy, when you fall into diverſe Temptations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that that our Saviour calls <hi>ſuffering of perſecution, Bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecution,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> calls here, <hi>ſuffering of tentation, Bleſſed is the man that endureth Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>paſſive</hi> quality, that is the <hi>Arrow</hi> that is here ſhot againſt this man of vertue, the ſubject of this Crowne to whom this promiſe is made.</p>
                  <p>But then there is the other, the entertainment that is to be given in that word, <hi>Endure</hi> tentations, it is not the <hi>having</hi> of Temptations that brings bleſſedneſſe, but the right <hi>bearing</hi> of it, the word is ſhort, but it is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, bleſſedneſſe is not pronounced to him that <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyds</hi> Temptation, it is true, no man is to <hi>draw</hi> it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily upon himſelfe, but there are men that think themſelves happy if they can <hi>withdraw</hi> their heads, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:114893:118"/>ſhift away out of Tribulation, though with the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> and the prejudice of piety that ſhall never have bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly, it is not pronounced to the <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of temptation, there are too many of that ſpirit, that <hi>ſlight</hi> the Meſſenger of chaſtiſement, and correction that God ſends, their hearts are <hi>hardened,</hi> as <hi>Pharoahs,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs,</hi> they are <hi>ſmitten,</hi> and doe not <hi>greive,</hi> as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines in Scripture, this is one of the worſe tempers of all. It is not <hi>patience,</hi> but <hi>ſtupidity,</hi> as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks, here is a <hi>patience</hi> would make a man <hi>impatient,</hi> worthy of <hi>impatience,</hi> a State worthy of <hi>reproofe,</hi> no, it is the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during</hi> of Temptation, and Tribulation, that hath the bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Enduring?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not <hi>all</hi> kind of enduring, there may be a <hi>bearing</hi> of Temptation, when there is <hi>murmuring, repineing,</hi> and <hi>diſcontent,</hi> that is not <hi>patience,</hi> that is not to <hi>beare,</hi> and indure; but take it then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſpeaking in generall, the <hi>enduring</hi> of tentation here mentioned, is <hi>patience,</hi> and patience is a vertue of a great extent, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeakes, it is a grace that hath a great <hi>latitude,</hi> you may bring it to theſe foure va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations, to know what it is to <hi>endure</hi> tribulation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to <hi>endure,</hi> that is, <hi>ſtoutly, couragiouſly,</hi> not to <hi>faint</hi> in Tribulation, a man that <hi>fainteth,</hi> more <hi>diſhonoureth</hi> piety by that, then he brought <hi>honour.</hi> It is not a <hi>faint</hi> patience, that is magnified, <hi>patience</hi> is a <hi>magnanimous,</hi> a <hi>heroick</hi> vertue, it muſt be a <hi>magnanimous</hi> patience that <hi>indures</hi> Tribulation, that is not <hi>diſcouraged</hi> with <hi>endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> but animated, and encouraged; dangers are ſo far from <hi>daunting</hi> the Spirit of a true patient mind, as they doe, but ſo much the more <hi>excite</hi> it to further induring: that is the firſt, it muſt be indured <hi>ſtoutly.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, to indure, that is, <hi>humbly,</hi> and <hi>meekly,</hi> for otherwiſe <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>fortitude,</hi> if it be not tempered with <hi>meekneſſe</hi> vapours forth into <hi>fury.</hi> There are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors often, when they are upon the <hi>wheele,</hi> and the <hi>rack,</hi> they will ſpit <hi>defiance,</hi> and ſeeme very <hi>reſolute.</hi> And many men when they are under <hi>Gods</hi> hand, in any great <hi>callamity,</hi> in any great <hi>Tribulation,</hi> you ſhall have them ſo <hi>impatient,</hi> that they vomit out <hi>blaſphemy</hi> againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is not <hi>grace,</hi> the effect of a <hi>valiant</hi> ſpirit, but of a <hi>deſperate</hi> ſpirit. <hi>Patience</hi> as it is a <hi>ſtout</hi> grace, ſo it is a <hi>humble</hi> grace, full of <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> that is true <hi>patience,</hi> that is <hi>callme</hi> and <hi>gentle,</hi> not <hi>furious</hi> not <hi>fierce.</hi> That is the ſecond, there muſt be, as the ſpirit of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> ſo the ſpirit of a <hi>Dove,</hi> mingled in <hi>patience,</hi> for the <hi>enduring</hi> of Tribulation, not onely to indure it <hi>ſtoutly,</hi> but <hi>meekly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to endure a right, that is, <hi>chearefully,</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men can indure calmly enough, and give a <hi>ſtill</hi> pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is not a <hi>ſtill</hi> patience, that is enough, but a chearfull patience, a patience that hath <hi>alacrity,</hi> a ſtill patience is ofttimes but a <hi>ſmothering</hi> patience. Men oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>bite</hi> in impatience, they ſpeake no <hi>diſcontented words,</hi> they ſhew no diſcontented <hi>geſture</hi> or <hi>looke,</hi> but yet they are ſullen and <hi>dejected,</hi> and thoughtfull, and caſt <hi>downe,</hi> it ſhews they are not <hi>pleaſed</hi> with Gods try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and excerciſe that he ſends: that that makes true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during is <hi>alacrity;</hi> a Chriſtian is not onely <hi>content,</hi> but <hi>willing</hi> to indure Tribulation, he labours after St. <hi>Pauls</hi> flight, he breaths after that excellent ſpirit to <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and to <hi>rejoyce in Tribulation,</hi> he takes it, not onely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, but thankfully, knowing that as in works of charity, <hi>God loves a chearfull</hi> giver, ſo in Tribulation God loves a <hi>chearfull</hi> endurer. That is the third, to endure with <hi>Chearfullneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Laſtly, that is not enough, but for a <hi>right</hi> enduring, there muſt be conſtancie, to endure with <hi>perſeverance,</hi> not to give over.</p>
                  <p>And what is it to endure with <hi>conſtancie?</hi> to make <hi>patience</hi> to runne to the <hi>end</hi> of her race, to draw the thread of patience to the greateſt <hi>length,</hi> for <hi>conſtancie</hi> is nothing but the <hi>length</hi> of <hi>patience; patience</hi> in her <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> worth is <hi>conſtancie,</hi> they are neere of kin, <hi>patience</hi> is a ſhort conſtancie, and <hi>conſtancie</hi> is a <hi>protracted</hi> patience, were it but an <hi>houre</hi> of temptation, <hi>ſhort</hi> tribulation, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie</hi> were not requiſite, but <hi>meere</hi> patience would ſerve the the turne, but Chriſt tels us, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repeates it oft, <hi>David tels</hi> us, and the Apoſtles tell us, that <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous,</hi> and <hi>through many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdome of God;</hi> that the end of one ſuffering is but a preparative a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to a ſecond, God armes us, and brings us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſufferings, by the firſt, and ſo to the ſecond, and to the third, and ſo to many times, that he may not get <hi>glorie</hi> only by us, but much glorie, ſeeing there are <hi>many great</hi> and <hi>long</hi> tribulations, we know what we <hi>deſerve,</hi> not what wee ſhall <hi>ſuffer;</hi> therefore there muſt be <hi>conſtancie</hi> to <hi>patience,</hi> that we may carrie away the <hi>bleſſing</hi> to make patience to runne out to the <hi>length, He that endureth unto the end,</hi> it is he that hath title unto the Crowne.</p>
                  <p>Here are now theſe ſeverall wayes that make up this <hi>enduring</hi> here ſpoken of; put theſe together, and you have the meaning of the Apoſtles words, what it is to <hi>endure</hi> tribulation.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is <hi>one</hi> more to be added to all theſe, not one that is diverſe from theſe foure, but that runns through all, though all theſe be joyned together, to endure <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, chearfully, meekly, ſtoutly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:114893:120"/>
                  <p>Yet if it be not in the cauſe of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>pietie,</hi> all theſe are nothing, this is that muſt be mingled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it muſt either be for, or in the cauſe of <hi>pietie,</hi> if it be true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> enduring, the caſe of <hi>martyrdome,</hi> that is for piety, the cauſe of <hi>innocencie,</hi> that is the caſe of pietie, either of theſe cauſes, are the cauſe of God, if theſe goe along withall the other properties then it is <hi>right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the word here be not ſupplyed, it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and ſupplyed in other places. <hi>Happie is the man that endureth tentation,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James</hi> indefinitely; but St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives the ſupplyment, <hi>If you ſuffer for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake, happie are yee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not every man that endures <hi>tribulation,</hi> that is <hi>happy,</hi> but he that endures for <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> ſake is happy, here, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that indureth tentation,</hi> but leaſt you ſhould miſtake, there is a ſupplement, Chriſt tels us what is that, for righteouſneſſe ſake, ſo ſupply it here. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that indureth tribulation or tentation for righteouſneſſe ſake, in</hi> and <hi>for</hi> righteouſneſſe, after a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous manner, he it is that hath a true title to <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> this is the other property not <hi>diſtinct,</hi> but that that goes through <hi>all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, though a man ſuffer for evill, and as a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, whether from God immediatly, or by men, he is tyed to ſuffer <hi>patiently,</hi> even when it is for <hi>evill</hi> doing.</p>
                  <p>But there is a great deale of difference betweene theſe two.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſuffering</hi> patiently for evill doing, and the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for righteouſneſſe ſake with patience, there is a great deale of difference.</p>
                  <p>A man that ſuffers for <hi>ſinne,</hi> and ſuffers the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his evill, his reward is a debt he owes to <hi>Juſtice,</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:114893:120"/>therefore in that caſe <hi>patienee</hi> is not an act of <hi>vertue</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but an adjunct of <hi>guilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when a man ſuffers for <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> ſake, this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>dedicates</hi> the devout man to <hi>God,</hi> there patience is not onely an act of <hi>vertue,</hi> but a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1.2. makes theſe plaine, when he tells us of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering as <hi>evill</hi> doers, and as <hi>Chriſtians. If any man ſuffer as an evill doer, what great matter</hi> is it, but if as a <hi>Chriſtian, that is praiſe worthy,</hi> he lets us underſtand, that <hi>patient</hi> ſuffering in <hi>evill</hi> doing is no great matter. That we are now ſtrictly, by nature tyed to doe, and by Law, and bond of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Or if it be <hi>commendable</hi> as well as the other, there is a great deale of difference, the one is <hi>commendable</hi> in an <hi>inferior</hi> manner, the other in an <hi>eminent</hi> way, the one onely is an act of <hi>conformity,</hi> the other of <hi>victory,</hi> to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>patiently,</hi> and for <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> ſake: Put theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you have the meaning of the words.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up all, what is the uſe we may make? brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly thus much.</p>
                  <p>To lead us to the right underſtanding of the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Temptations,</hi> and Tribulations, that you may ſee there is a great deale of <hi>comfort,</hi> and a great deale of <hi>honour</hi> and contentment in the <hi>right</hi> enduring of them, and that it is a grace to be laboured for, that we may <hi>attain.</hi> And that we may attaine the right enduring of tentation: One grace above all is to be learned.</p>
                  <p>Labour for <hi>patience</hi> under the Croſſe, for patience in affliction and Tribulation, labour for that grace, it is that excellent grace that hath a mixture in every grace. It is <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> the <hi>keeper</hi> of all other vertues, of <hi>faith, hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and every other grace, they all come to their end by the preſervation of <hi>patience,</hi> they would faint all were it not for <hi>patience;</hi> Patience lends ſupport
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114893:121"/>to <hi>every</hi> grace, as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeakes well. It is the <hi>roote</hi> of all thoſe flowers in the wreath of Chriſtian vertues, the roote of all thoſe graces. Patience, who can tell the <hi>uſefullneſſe</hi> of it? it is uſefull to a man in <hi>all</hi> conditions, if his li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Beſides, it is the grace that God honours in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his <hi>approbation,</hi> he promiſeth a reward to no grace more frequently, then to this.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it is the grace that God honours, with the name he takes to <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and ſet us an example even from himſelfe, he condiſcends to ſet us an Example of <hi>longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity. Mercy</hi> it ſelfe doth not more extoll Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then his <hi>patience</hi> doth, for <hi>patience</hi> is more then <hi>mercy,</hi> for patience is <hi>multiplied,</hi> renewed <hi>mercy,</hi> he could ſhew no <hi>mercy,</hi> but for <hi>patience.</hi> Therefore he takes the name, as the God of <hi>judgement,</hi> ſo of <hi>patience,</hi> he ſets us the example of himſelfe, that we might learne to get this grace.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, patience is the proper <hi>mark</hi> of a Chriſtian, if the Croſſe of Chriſt be the <hi>badge,</hi> the bearing of the the Croſſe, the cognizance of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> a Chriſtian is not knowne by any thing more, then by <hi>ſuffering,</hi> and therefore is to be defined by no grace more then <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> the grace of <hi>ſuffering.</hi> In one of the <hi>firſt</hi> words Chriſt ſpake in the Goſpell, he calls to the <hi>Croſſe. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will come after me, let him take up his Croſſe,</hi> by the ſame word he called us to <hi>patience,</hi> therefore it is one of the <hi>firſt</hi> graces that Chriſt forceth, it is the very <hi>mark</hi> of a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>And it is that grace that carries a man <hi>through</hi> all <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,</hi> that <hi>ſweetens</hi> all <hi>afflictions</hi> whatſoever; admit a man endure <hi>poverty,</hi> if he have <hi>contentation</hi> he doth not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:114893:121"/>feele it, it is all one not to <hi>have</hi> the world, and not to <hi>want</hi> it; he that <hi>wants</hi> not, hath <hi>abundance; contentation</hi> is <hi>abundance</hi> in the middeſt of <hi>want:</hi> And ſo for affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it is all one not to <hi>have</hi> affliction, and to <hi>bear</hi> it, if there be patience; <hi>patience</hi> never feeles it, no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction can be <hi>weighty,</hi> if <hi>Patience</hi> bee there it beares all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Impatience</hi> turnes every thing <hi>contrary:</hi> If a man have <hi>fulneſſe,</hi> yet if a man have an <hi>impatient</hi> ſpirit, he is in affliction, in <hi>happineſſe</hi> and <hi>aboundance:</hi> as <hi>covetouſneſſe</hi> makes a man alwayes <hi>want,</hi> ſo <hi>impatience</hi> make a man alwayes <hi>afflicted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take it by a familiar inſtance; if a bird taken in a lime-twig ſit <hi>ſtill;</hi> if ſhe have a little <hi>patience,</hi> there may be hopes of recovery: but while ſhe flutters her wings, ſhe is more faſt taken; by <hi>ſtirring</hi> ſhe brings her ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>greater</hi> afflictions: So a man, if he be <hi>wounded,</hi> if hee be of a <hi>fiery</hi> nature, and fret within, if he be of a <hi>fretting</hi> ſpirit, it makes the wound <hi>worſe,</hi> and not <hi>better:</hi> So if a man be in <hi>bonds</hi> and in fetters, and he begin to be <hi>impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> and to <hi>ſtirre</hi> much, and to ſtrive with the bonds, the bonds will make him <hi>lame;</hi> but if he would endure them with <hi>quietneſſe,</hi> the bonds are no <hi>bonds,</hi> he feeles them not after they are once ſetled: So in a <hi>feaver,</hi> if a man keepe himſelfe in a calme temper, and do not <hi>ſtirre</hi> and <hi>toſſe</hi> up and downe, by toleration the fervor of the feaver diminiſheth; if he be <hi>unquiet,</hi> it encreaſeth the feaver. So it is with all <hi>afflictions</hi> that God layes upon us; if we have impatient ſpirits, the more we <hi>ſtirre</hi> and <hi>fret,</hi> and <hi>vexe</hi> our ſelves, the more we encreaſe our owne tribulation, <hi>patience</hi> is only that that <hi>ſweetens</hi> and <hi>ſeaſons</hi> all.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if wee will rightly come to <hi>ſuffer</hi> and endure tribulation: get the grace of <hi>Patience,</hi> it is worth
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:114893:122"/>our labour by <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>meditation,</hi> and by whatſoever good meanes wee may have a happy ſupply of it.</p>
                  <p>Yet that is not all; for there muſt be the other graces joyned to <hi>patience: Conſtancy,</hi> for <hi>patience</hi> will not come to <hi>victory,</hi> except <hi>conſtancy</hi> carry it to the <hi>end</hi> of the race, therefore the <hi>bleſſing</hi> is not joyned to <hi>patience,</hi> but it is joyned to <hi>conſtancy.

                  <p>And now I am to proceed unto the ſecond branch, that is, of the <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>retribution</hi> it ſelfe, it is in theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed ſhall he be, and he ſhall receive the crown of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are the words that hover over the other, the deſcription of the perſon, as the opening of the heavens did over <hi>Stephen</hi> when he was ſtoned. Here is <hi>Stephens</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonie, <hi>the man that endures tribulation:</hi> and then comes in his <hi>bleſſedneſſe, the crowne of life,</hi> as the opening of the heavens to encourage every Chriſtian the better for the enduring the conflict. It followes upon the firſt in a very good order: for there is nothing that will ſtirre us up more to <hi>endure</hi> tribulation with <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of ſpirit, then the thought of the <hi>reward.</hi> It is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution that every man propounds to himſelfe in any undertaking, whether it be of action or paſſion, <hi>quid ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebo,</hi> what ſhall I have, if I <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>ſuffer?</hi> Theſe are the voyces of all men, both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad, worldly</hi> men and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Even <hi>Judas</hi> himſelfe when he went about that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill work of betraying Chriſt, he encouraged himſelf by this word, <hi>what will you give mee, and I will betray him to you?</hi> Nay, and the Diſciples themſelves in a matter of greater moment, a thing that concerned <hi>heaven</hi> (as the diſcourſe doth that we are now about) they propound it to our bleſſed Saviour; S. <hi>Peter</hi> moves him with this, <hi>Lord, we have left all and followed thee, what ſhall we receive?</hi> And it was the cuſtome of <hi>Princes,</hi> when they they ſet about any great achievement or undertaking, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the undertakers to come to the worke, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>wages,</hi> and <hi>prizes,</hi> and <hi>rewards,</hi> that they might draw them to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Generalls,</hi> when they goe to fight, to encourage their
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:114893:124"/>Souldiers to fight, they uſe to make promiſes of <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> to make them more reſolute, and valiant. The ſame courſe here, the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> takes in the deſcription of the great work he was about. As a heavenly <hi>cryer,</hi> he was to make publication here, of a great undertaking, the <hi>enduring</hi> of <hi>tribulation:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee would not miſſe of his ayme, but encourage many to come to the cheerfull undertaking here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; he propounds to them the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of the <hi>reward,</hi> that he may allay the <hi>ſharpneſſe</hi> of the <hi>ſuffering.</hi> He lends the <hi>poore</hi> man that is in tribulation here, a <hi>ſtaffe</hi> to reſt on; it is not only <hi>one</hi> ſtaffe, but <hi>two, Bleſſedneſſe</hi> is the one, and the <hi>Crowne</hi> of life is the other. Theſe are good props: a <hi>thorne</hi> was in the <hi>firſt</hi> word, the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during</hi> of tribulation; but here is that that recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it, here is a <hi>Crowne</hi> and <hi>Bleſſedneſſe</hi> in theſe other words that I am now to ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>It is not bleſſedneſſe <hi>deferred;</hi> the Apoſtle in a great deale of wiſdome <hi>begins</hi> with bleſſedneſſe; he doth not name <hi>tribulation</hi> without <hi>bleſſedneſſe.</hi> When <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> is named, a man may ſafely name <hi>tribulation.</hi> It takes in all, what <hi>God</hi> will <hi>give,</hi> bleſſedneſſe, and what the man that endures temptation is to <hi>receive</hi> from Gods hand, that we cannot apprehend the glory of the <hi>crown</hi> of life.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the two things:</p>
                  <p>The one of them is the <hi>generall</hi> deſcription of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>The other the <hi>particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>generall</hi> deſcription of the reward in this word.</p>
                  <q>Bleſſed is the man.</q>
                  <p>It is <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> that is the <hi>ſum</hi> of all <hi>comfort,</hi> and the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:114893:125"/>
                     <hi>retribution</hi> that is promiſed to the <hi>enduring</hi> of Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And what ſhall I now ſay to you of that? It is the thing that is in all your <hi>hearts,</hi> and in the hopes and aimes of every man, <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſſe,</hi> even by the light of <hi>nature.</hi> Though it be in all our <hi>hearts,</hi> it is not in our <hi>underſtandings: Paul</hi> can reſolve us for that, whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that are <hi>good,</hi> are ſubject to the <hi>eye,</hi> we muſt not looke to have it in this reſpect, <hi>Eye hath not ſeene.</hi> Of other things, the comforts of <hi>Gods ſpirit,</hi> we may tell how they are deſcribed in Scripture, and you receive them by the <hi>eare;</hi> but of bleſſedneſſe Celeſtiall, no tongue of Angells can ſpeake ſufficiently, <hi>Eare hath not heard it.</hi> Yet the things that <hi>eare</hi> hath not heard, it is poſſible for the <hi>heart</hi> to imagine, we may indeed in repreſentation, but we cannot in the fullneſſe, <hi>It hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive.</hi> How great that good is, that is compriſed in this ſmall compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>Bleſſedneſſe,</hi> take it thus.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>two</hi> things acknowledged by all, even by thoſe that have little inſight into it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, that <hi>Beatitude</hi> it is the <hi>higheſt</hi> and the <hi>greateſt</hi> of all <hi>good</hi> things, that can be expected, that <hi>nothing</hi> can be imagined <hi>above</hi> this. It is the <hi>fruition</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it is whatſoever is ſet forth to us in Scripture, to make us underſtand that glory.</p>
                  <p>It is not onely <hi>ſummam,</hi> but the moſt <hi>ſpacious,</hi> it <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends</hi> in it <hi>all</hi> good things whatſoever; <hi>Beatitude</hi> is ſo great a good, that as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves, <hi>every</hi> man would be partaker of <hi>Beatitude,</hi> not onely the <hi>good,</hi> but even <hi>bad</hi> men, that will not conforme to the rules of piety, that lead to <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> they would faine have <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> though they care not for <hi>piety.</hi> And there is <hi>no</hi> man that heares me now, that is never ſo much <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted</hi> with the name of <hi>Tribulation,</hi> but would be glad
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114893:125"/>to imbrace <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> they love the <hi>end</hi> but not the <hi>way.</hi> It muſt needs be a <hi>great</hi> good that <hi>all,</hi> out of that <hi>ſmall</hi> glimpſe of light that they have, yet with ſo much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe <hi>deſire.</hi> It is ſo <hi>great</hi> a good, that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends in it <hi>all</hi> good things whatſoever. It is, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, the <hi>accumulation</hi> of <hi>all</hi> good, it muſt needs be the accumulation of <hi>all</hi> good, becauſe it is the reward of <hi>every</hi> good action, if it be the reward of <hi>every</hi> good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it muſt needs include <hi>every</hi> good comfort.</p>
                  <p>There is no <hi>number</hi> can expreſſe thoſe ſeverall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſes of the <hi>eight</hi> beatitudes, that Chriſt ſpeaks of in one place, and <hi>foure</hi> in another; St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> wittily moves the Queſtion why, when <hi>Matthew</hi> reckons eight Beatitudes, St. <hi>Luke</hi> reckons but <hi>foure?</hi> He anſwers thus, the <hi>foure</hi> are in the <hi>eight,</hi> and the <hi>eight</hi> in the <hi>foure,</hi> the <hi>eight</hi> are no more then the <hi>foure,</hi> and the <hi>foure</hi> are no <hi>leſſe</hi> then the <hi>eight.</hi> So here, though it be but once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>yet</hi> that <hi>one</hi> is as much, as the <hi>twelve,</hi> the <hi>eight,</hi> and the <hi>four,</hi> put together. It's the accumulation of all good, therefore it is ſet forth in Scripture by all words that expreſſe not ions that are deſirable, <hi>Reſt, Joy, Peace, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>contentment,</hi> and <hi>immortality,</hi> all is <hi>bleſſedneſſe.</hi> It is a word of that ſweetneſſe, that the Prophets, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, they ſtill had it in their mouths; they ſeldome make mention of any duty, but ſtill <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> though it be the <hi>end</hi> of all, is ſet in the <hi>beginning</hi> of thoſe duties they enforce. <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> they all urge it expreſly, and put us in mind of it, though in ſeverall expreſſions. Take the difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he propounds it as the reward of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he ſets it downe in the <hi>future, Beatus erit,</hi> if thou walk in my Commandements, <hi>Bleſſed ſhalt thou be in thy Basket, and in thy ſtore, in the Citty, and abroad in thy going out, and thy comming in.</hi> On the other fide, <hi>David</hi> when
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:114893:126"/>he mentions it, he puts it indeed in the <hi>preſent,</hi> but he ſets it in the <hi>Negative, Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that hath not walked in the Counſell of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of ſinners, nor ſat in the ſeat of the ſcornefull.</hi> In the third place, our bleſſed Saviour when he comes to mention it, he hath another variation, it is not in the <hi>future,</hi> as <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is not in the <hi>negative</hi> as the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> but he propounds it in the <hi>plurall, Bleſſed are the poore in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, bleſſed are the meeke, bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt,</hi> and ſo the reſt are all <hi>plurall,</hi> when Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the purchaſe of <hi>beatitude,</hi> for all that ſuffer. Here yet it is different from them all in the pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of St. <hi>James,</hi> it is not in the <hi>future</hi> as <hi>Moſes,</hi> but in the <hi>preſent;</hi> it is not <hi>negative</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>affirmative;</hi> it is not <hi>plurall</hi> as our bleſſed Saviour, but <hi>ſingular.</hi> Not as if there were different publications, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would raiſe it to the <hi>upſhot,</hi> and improve it to the <hi>beſt</hi> advantage: for all the reſt are in this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake not all when he propounded it in the future, <hi>Bleſſed ſhalt thou be,</hi> he doth not expreſſe all. It is not <hi>all</hi> that is given to the Saints of God to have <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> they are not onely <hi>bleſſed</hi> in <hi>hope,</hi> but in <hi>act;</hi> they have not onely a <hi>future</hi> heaven, but a <hi>preſent.</hi> Not in poſſeſſion? Yes, in <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> but not in <hi>full</hi> fruition; but they have ſome poſſeſſion. The <hi>Harveſt</hi> is not now, that is at the end of the World, the <hi>firſt fruits,</hi> that is a part of that bleſſedneſſe, as <hi>grace</hi> is the <hi>beginning</hi> of <hi>glory.</hi> The <hi>firſt fruits</hi> they have here, and becauſe they have the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> here, therefore they have not bleſſedneſſe onely in <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>expectation,</hi> but in <hi>actuall</hi> poſſeſſion, as a part of it; and not onely, <hi>bleſſed ſhalt thou be,</hi> but a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man <hi>is</hi> bleſſed already: therefore the Apoſtle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the <hi>future</hi> to the <hi>preſent,</hi> not onely bleſſed <hi>ſhall,</hi> but <hi>bleſſed is the man,</hi> that is one.</p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:114893:126"/>
                  <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayd not <hi>all</hi> in the <hi>future;</hi> ſo next <hi>David</hi> ſaid not <hi>all,</hi> when he expreſſeth it in the <hi>negative, Bleſſed is the man that hath not walked in the Counſell of the ungodly.</hi> This expreſſeth it not to the full. It is true, <hi>bleſſing</hi> is propounded to the <hi>avoyding</hi> and ſhunning of <hi>ſin,</hi> but the <hi>greateſt</hi> bleſſing belongs to the <hi>following,</hi> and proſecution of <hi>piety, not</hi> to doe <hi>evill,</hi> is <hi>good,</hi> but to <hi>doe good,</hi> is <hi>much</hi> better: it is not enough that we be not <hi>prophane,</hi> nor <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,</hi> nor <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> nor <hi>Drunkards,</hi> nor <hi>Murtherers,</hi> nor <hi>Liers,</hi> nor <hi>Swearers,</hi> that is not enough, yet there is part of the bleſſing in that, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that hath not wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the Counſell of the ungodly.</hi> There is <hi>Davids beatus,</hi> but it is much <hi>more</hi> that God expects of us, the <hi>doing</hi> of good; that we be <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>beleiving, fruitfull</hi> in <hi>good</hi> works, and in <hi>every</hi> good work, that is it that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the <hi>greater</hi> bleſſing, the <hi>affirmative,</hi> doing, and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling Gods Commandements, and walking in thoſe wayes that he hath appointed, that gets the <hi>greateſt</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Therefore that is the reaſon the Apoſtle corrects it here, and improves it to <hi>Davids negative.</hi> It is not <hi>Beatus qui non,</hi> but <hi>Beatus qui ſit, Bleſſed is the man that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth,</hi> that is the ſecond, but that is not <hi>all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>David</hi> ſayd not all in the <hi>negative,</hi> ſo our bleſſed Saviour expreſſeth not all in the <hi>plurall, Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, and bleſſed are the meeke.</hi> It is more to have it in the <hi>Singular,</hi> that brings it home to <hi>every</hi> mans <hi>heart,</hi> to <hi>every</hi> mans <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> and application, yet both put together make it full; <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> is propounded in the <hi>Plurall</hi> to all, and in the <hi>ſingular</hi> to <hi>every</hi> man that walks in the way of vertue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What is the reaſon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It belongs as much to <hi>every</hi> one in <hi>particular,</hi> as to all in <hi>generall;</hi> the thing that <hi>all</hi> expect, is no <hi>more</hi> then <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> the thing that <hi>every</hi> man may look for, is no
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:114893:127"/>leſſe then bleſſedneſſe. Bleſſedneſſe is that that will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>all,</hi> and bleſſedneſſe is that that will inrich euery <hi>particular</hi> man. Therefore the Apoſtle brings it lower then the <hi>plurall,</hi> that every man may have a ſpecial por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of comfort for one of theſe two reaſons.</p>
                  <p>One reaſon may be this, he ſets it in the <hi>ſingular,</hi> not in the <hi>plurall, bleſſed is the man;</hi> as partly deſpairing, that there would not be <hi>many</hi> that would embrace this doctrine of the croſſe, it would hardly come to a <hi>plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Every man with-draws his necke from <hi>tribulation.</hi> Though there be the <hi>Crowne</hi> ſet at the end of all thoſe propoſitions of <hi>ſuffering;</hi> yet we had rather hazard the loſſe of the <hi>Crowne,</hi> then ſubmit our necks to beare the <hi>yoake</hi> of afflictions. The Apoſtle could not think there would be <hi>many,</hi> hardly a <hi>number,</hi> hee could hardly ſay <hi>beati,</hi> but ſhuts it up <hi>beatus, bleſſed is the man, one of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and two of a Tribe,</hi> a few <hi>gleanings,</hi> a <hi>ſmall</hi> gathering, and therefore he ſets it in the ſingular.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is, to let us ſee that in particular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe is <hi>every</hi> mans comfort: Though every man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell not in <hi>all</hi> graces, no not the Saints of God, yet each of them excells in <hi>bleſſedneſſe. To one is given the gift of faith by the ſame ſpirit,</hi> to another <hi>repentance;</hi> hee is more eminent in that: to another <hi>charity.</hi> Here are <hi>ſeverall</hi> graces and gifts; as there are ſeverall gifts, ſo there ſhall be <hi>ſeverall rewards:</hi> The reward is but <hi>one</hi> bleſſedneſſe for all: Therefore in Scripture it is propounded as the retribution of every grace: As the reward of <hi>faith, Bleſſed is the man that truſts in him:</hi> As the reward of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Bleſſed are they that keepe his Testimonies:</hi> As the reward of <hi>purity, Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way.</hi> Why ſhould I name more? the Scripture is full. But take this as the cloſe of all, it is the reward propounded to the <hi>enduring</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> of tribulation: <hi>Bleſſed is the man
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:114893:127"/>that endureth tribulation.</hi> It is true, of all other, a man would have thought, it might beſt have beene ſpared here; for that it is the reward of <hi>faith,</hi> that a man that <hi>believes,</hi> and his <hi>hope</hi> reſts in God, that he ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, theſe are comfortable: but that a man in the <hi>fornace</hi> of affliction, and all-beſme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Worldly men are of another opinion, they think not that <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> can conſiſt with <hi>tribulation</hi> and <hi>perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> They think that bleſſedneſſe conſiſts with <hi>eaſe,</hi> and <hi>reſt,</hi> with <hi>pleaſures</hi> and <hi>profits,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>applauſe,</hi> and the enjoyment of <hi>good</hi> things in the <hi>world:</hi> here is that they ſet up their reſt in, here they place their <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.</hi> See the different voyce of the world, and of Chriſt; of ſecular men, and the Apoſtles: <hi>Bleſſed are they that ſuffer</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt: O miſerable</hi> are they that <hi>ſuffer</hi> ſaith the <hi>world.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:114893:128"/>becauſe he would breake the way, <hi>lead</hi> the ranck; that he might lead us along chearfully, to <hi>endure</hi> Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, he hath taſted the Cup <hi>firſt.</hi> There is no <hi>drop</hi> in the Cup of Tribulation, that Chriſt did not firſt taſt of. The <hi>contempt</hi> of the World, <hi>diſgrace</hi> upon the Croſſe, he had <hi>obloquie</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> of a Publican, and Sinner. If <hi>torments</hi> be another drop of the Cup of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, he ſuſtained them firſt; his <hi>back he laid open to the Smiters,</hi> he was <hi>ſtript,</hi> and <hi>bound,</hi> and <hi>buffetted,</hi> theſe were the things that he ſuſtained. If <hi>death</hi> it ſelfe be the <hi>laſt</hi> drop of the Cup of Tribulation, he <hi>taſted</hi> of it firſt. He that is the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> taſted the <hi>potion</hi> firſt, he did not onely <hi>taſt</hi> it, but <hi>drink</hi> it firſt. As St. <hi>Gregorie</hi> well; the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> he drank firſt, that we that are <hi>Patients,</hi> might drink it chearfully. Who can judge of <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,</hi> and <hi>rewards,</hi> better then he that ſuffered <hi>firſt?</hi> that is Chriſt? What ſaith Chriſt? He tells us of <hi>woes,</hi> and he tells us of <hi>bleſſings.</hi> The woes, what are they? Wo to you that are <hi>poore?</hi> No, <hi>wo to you that are rich.</hi> Wo to you that <hi>mourne?</hi> No, <hi>wo to you that laugh.</hi> Wo to you that are <hi>empty?</hi> No, <hi>wo to you that are full.</hi> Here are the woes, ſee the bleſſings. How begin the bleſſings in <hi>Matthew?</hi> Bleſſed are the <hi>rich?</hi> No, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor.</hi> So he begins, how <hi>ends</hi> he the bleſſings there? Bleſſed are thoſe that <hi>avoyd</hi> perſecution? No, <hi>Bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecution.</hi> Here is Chriſts deſcription of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Then here is the ſumm of all, that the <hi>ſuffering</hi> of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, it is a ſtate makes truly <hi>bleſſed;</hi> the <hi>right</hi> endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Tribulation,</hi> and affliction, is a State that makes truely <hi>bleſſed,</hi> not onely in <hi>hope,</hi> but in <hi>act,</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Is there any thing of greater comfort, then that a man, when he is accounted the <hi>off-ſcouring of the World,</hi> caſt out as the <hi>Dung of the Earth,</hi> when he is <hi>vile</hi> in the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:114893:129"/>eyes of <hi>all</hi> men, <hi>forſaken</hi> of all, and <hi>deſolate,</hi> yet in regard of God, that poore diſtreſſed Creature that hath no comfort, that is like <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Goſpell, at that very time, ſhall have the <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> and the <hi>beginnings</hi> of it in himſelfe? Here is a great deale of happineſſe in the ſuffering of tribulation, it is a ſtate ſo far from being <hi>repugnant</hi> to beatitude, that it is <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with it at the ſame time. And beatitude is ſo far from being <hi>abhorrent,</hi> or from being <hi>different</hi> from <hi>ſuffering</hi> tribulation, that it aſſures it to us. Theſe two are ſtill joyned in Scripture, the <hi>croſs,</hi> and the <hi>bleſſing; Tribulation,</hi> and <hi>happineſs.</hi> Seeing the Scripture <hi>joynes</hi> them, take heed that we doe not <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> them. There are two onely wayes whereby we may ſever them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, doe not ſever <hi>Tribulation</hi> from <hi>bleſſedneſſe,</hi> that is one, take heed that we doe not that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How is that?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man then ſevers <hi>Tribulation</hi> from the <hi>bleſſing,</hi> when he would faine be partaker of the <hi>beatitude,</hi> but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the <hi>Tribulation.</hi> As there be many men that are very good in their <hi>judgement</hi> of bleſſedneſſe, and think beatitude is the <hi>beſt</hi> eſtate, yet they are loath to have the Croſſe along; <hi>halfe</hi> their judgement is good, and <hi>halfe</hi> naught. Remember God hath <hi>joyned</hi> them, he hath made Tribulation walke before. If we will <hi>reigne with Chriſt, we muſt ſuffer with him.</hi> If we looke to <hi>live</hi> with Chriſt, we muſt alſo <hi>endure</hi> with him; if we will have the <hi>reward,</hi> we muſt look to the <hi>condition.</hi> Look over all the Scripture and you ſhall find that no Saint of God was ever exempted from Tribulation, <hi>Et labor &amp; dolor,</hi> &amp;c. as one ſayth, from the very <hi>firſt</hi> man that came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, to the <hi>end,</hi> godly men have ſtill <hi>thornes</hi> in their way, <hi>perſecution,</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering.</hi> The
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114893:129"/>whole World is as a great <hi>Furnace,</hi> or as a great <hi>Ship</hi> that carries a great many ſouls, that are in jeopardie of the floud ſtill: So the <hi>World</hi> is to <hi>men,</hi> it is more then ſo to a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> the <hi>Marks</hi> at which the <hi>Arrows</hi> of Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſhot, are eſpecially the <hi>whiteſt</hi> marks, the <hi>faireſt</hi> marks; thoſe that are <hi>pure, and undefiled in the way.</hi> The Scriptures doe no where promiſe the bleſſing, without the Tribulation, <hi>Nemo, &amp;c.</hi> ſayth a Father, let no man <hi>flatter</hi> himſelfe, and <hi>promiſe</hi> himſelfe, that that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not promiſe: The Scripture no where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth bleſſing, to the courſe of the <hi>impenitent,</hi> no where to them that <hi>decline</hi> the Croſſe, but to them that take it up. If the bleſſing be <hi>joyned</hi> to Tribulation, let us joine them, and not <hi>ſever</hi> them: that is the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as we muſt not ſever <hi>tribulation</hi> from bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo we muſt not ſever <hi>bleſsedneſs</hi> from <hi>Tribulation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How is that done?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men ſever <hi>bleſsedneſs</hi> from <hi>Tribulation,</hi> when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce godly men <hi>miſerable,</hi> becauſe they indure tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the World. The <hi>World</hi> accounts them <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> that God accounts <hi>happy;</hi> thoſe whom God hath made happy, it is very <hi>vaine</hi> and <hi>raſh</hi> judgement for men to pronounce them miſerable. Generally we think ſo, we think them <hi>miſerable</hi> men, though they be <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> if they be oppreſſed with Tribulation, we meaſure all for the preſent. We muſt not ſever <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs</hi> from <hi>tribulation.</hi> It is juſt as people that are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, when they ſee the Sun Eclipſed, they think the Sun hath no <hi>light,</hi> becauſe for the time it is darkened, they think there is no Sun, becauſe it is <hi>cloudy,</hi> or that the Sun is loſt, becauſe he is ſo to ſence. Worldly men are Creatures of <hi>ſence,</hi> they cannot judge of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things, they ſee the <hi>diſcomforts</hi> of godly men, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee their comforts. The <hi>diſcomforts</hi> are <hi>without,</hi> the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:114893:130"/>
                     <hi>comforts</hi> are <hi>within,</hi> the one is diſcerned by the <hi>carnall,</hi> the other by the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> eye. Therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they are <hi>miſerable,</hi> becauſe they <hi>ſee</hi> not their <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> juſt as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayth, as if a man ſhould conclude that the <hi>Sea</hi> were not <hi>deepe,</hi> becauſe there are <hi>ſhallows</hi> towards the ſhore; or that the whole <hi>Earth</hi> were not <hi>fruitfull,</hi> becauſe there are ſome <hi>Deſarts barren;</hi> or that the frame of it were not <hi>round,</hi> becauſe there are <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous</hi> places; ſo it is with theſe temporall afflictions. The <hi>Mountaines</hi> and Hills carry no proportion to ſo great a body, to hinder the perfect <hi>roundneſſe</hi> of the Earth. <hi>Bleſſedneſſe</hi> is that that belongs to godly men, afflictions and <hi>Tribulations</hi> as <hi>mole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hills,</hi> and un-even places cannot hinder their happineſſe. In their <hi>owne</hi> ſight it may ſometimes, it may be, there are <hi>ſhallows</hi> in Tribulation, but <hi>glory,</hi> the Sea is <hi>deepe</hi> for all that, there is deepe <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> reſerved for them. Heare the pronunciation of the Spirit of God ofter then once, <hi>Behold we account them happy that ſuffer,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>you</hi> account them <hi>miſerable,</hi> but <hi>we</hi> account them <hi>happy: and I think we have the ſpirit of God,</hi> he might have ſaid ſo, the ſpirit of God taught them all theſe truths, <hi>we account them happy, bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, what is the ſumm and the uſe? Seing that it is thus pronounced to thoſe that <hi>endure</hi> Tribulation; we all are in love with <hi>bleſsedneſſe,</hi> we all <hi>deſire</hi> that; if we be deſirers of happineſſe, let us doe <hi>wiſely,</hi> take that courſe that may bring us thither, labour to be found in that number that it is promiſed to; if we be found out of that number, we muſt not looke for bleſſedneſſe. Every man that ſhall inherit bleſſedneſſe, muſt be in the compaſſe of thoſe quallified perſons that it is promiſed to; labour to be of that number. I tell you <hi>bleſsedneſſe</hi> is promiſed to <hi>holineſs, Bleſſed are the pure in heart.</hi> He
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:114893:130"/>that gets <hi>purity</hi> of heart, hath aſſurance of bleſſedneſſe. <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> is promiſed to the <hi>meek,</hi> to the <hi>poor</hi> in ſpirit, to thoſe that feare God, and truſt in him, let us be <hi>qualified,</hi> according to the condition of theſe perſons, and we have aſſurance of <hi>bleſſedneſs.</hi> Come to the Text, here is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, To whom is it? To thoſe that are at <hi>eaſe in Zion?</hi> Or to thoſe that <hi>Crowne themſelves with Roſe-buds?</hi> That let <hi>no</hi> pleaſures paſſe, thoſe that <hi>ſtretch themſelves upon beds of Ivory,</hi> that <hi>chant to the ſound of the Organ?</hi> Thoſe that make their <hi>Heaven, Earth,</hi> and make their <hi>happineſs, pleaſures,</hi> is the promiſe to them? No, it is <hi>woe</hi> that is threatened to them; thoſe that <hi>eat</hi> Gods people as <hi>bread,</hi> it is not <hi>bleſſing,</hi> but a <hi>woe</hi> to them, and the woe ſleeps not. To whom is the promiſe here? Breifly, beſides all the other promiſes in Scripture, here is one of the principall, <hi>Bleſsed is the man that endureth temptation.</hi> If we be of that number, here is <hi>bleſsedneſs.</hi> That is the firſt part, the reward promiſed, it is a <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>full</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>bleſsedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I come from the generall propoſition of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the particular. That is, to goe from <hi>good</hi> to <hi>better,</hi> though there be nothing better then <hi>bleſsedneſs,</hi> yet in our <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> ſomething may make it more <hi>lively</hi> in our apprehenſion, to our capacity. That is in the otherword, the man that endures Tribulation, ſhall <hi>receive the Crowne of life:</hi> that is the <hi>particular</hi> reward. <hi>Bleſsedneſs</hi> is the <hi>generall,</hi> the <hi>Crowne of life</hi> is the <hi>particular.</hi> And in theſe words, as St. <hi>Cryſoſtome</hi> ſayth well, there is great <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> they are <hi>both</hi> emphaticall, for <hi>life</hi> is the beſt of all <hi>naturall</hi> things, and a <hi>Crowne</hi> is the beſt of all things <hi>civill.</hi> Here is the <hi>beſt,</hi> and the <hi>beſt.</hi> O then what a <hi>bleſſing,</hi> and a <hi>good,</hi> is a <hi>Crowne,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> both joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and theſe in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ſence. <hi>The Crowne of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:114893:131"/>
                  <p>The Apoſtle might have ſpared theſe words, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as I ſaid before, there is nothing to be added to <hi>bleſsedneſs,</hi> he that names <hi>bleſsedneſs,</hi> names <hi>all.</hi> But for our further ſatisfaction, he adds theſe two words, and puts them with a <hi>For, FOR he ſhall receive the Crowne of life.</hi> Either as a <hi>proofe</hi> of the former part, or as an <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Take them <hi>argumentatively,</hi> or <hi>exegetically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you take them <hi>argumentatively,</hi> ſo it is good, leaſt any ſhould think, St. <hi>James</hi> making the former propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was a <hi>Parodox,</hi> as worldly men are prone to doe, when he ſaid, <hi>Bleſsed are they that endure tribulation,</hi> he ſtrengthens it with an undeniable reaſon, onely by this, <hi>FOR he ſhall receive the Crowne of life.</hi> It ſtands thus, where ever there is <hi>immortality,</hi> there is <hi>bleſsedneſs,</hi> and where ever there is the <hi>Crowne of life,</hi> there is <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity;</hi> it is therefore called the <hi>Crowne of life,</hi> becauſe it is the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>eternall</hi> life, that is, of <hi>immortallity,</hi> that <hi>bleſsedneſs</hi> he proves by this <hi>medium,</hi> they are bleſſed: <hi>FOR they ſhall receive the Crowne of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you take it <hi>exegetically</hi> too, it is upon good reaſon why this word is added, it is an <hi>explication</hi> of the former. Leſt any ſhould <hi>miſtake</hi> the Apoſtle when he pronounced <hi>bleſsedneſs</hi> to <hi>tribulation,</hi> and have thought that bleſſedneſſe might be attained in this World, he puts it off with this explication, it is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, but you muſt not think to have that portion here, it is bleſſedneſſe that is to be <hi>had,</hi> where the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>life</hi> is. It is the bleſſedneſſe of <hi>life,</hi> but not of <hi>this,</hi> but of <hi>eternall</hi> life. You cannot have the Crownes here, thoſe are the bleſſings that all Chriſtians cannot look for, <hi>Empires,</hi> and <hi>Crownes</hi> here; but this is <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> there they expect <hi>bleſsedneſs,</hi> where there is the <hi>Crowne.</hi> They are bleſſed in the <hi>beginnings</hi> now, and ſhall be <hi>fully</hi> after; but it is there, where the Crowne of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:114893:131"/>life ſhall be put upon them. <hi>In the World</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>life</hi> is in the <hi>other</hi> World, ſayth St. <hi>Gregory, this</hi> life is the life of <hi>conflict, that</hi> of <hi>Crownes,</hi> and <hi>Wreaths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, a godly man hath his <hi>Crowne here, Paul</hi> had <hi>one,</hi> but that was an <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> Crowne, when he ſpake to the <hi>Phillippians, my joy and my Crowne,</hi> that is not <hi>every</hi> mans: but <hi>every</hi> godly man hath a <hi>Crowne here.</hi> I will tell you one Crowne every <hi>good conſcience</hi> hath, the ſame that is <hi>a continuall feaſt,</hi> the ſame is a <hi>Crowne.</hi> Nay further, every Believer, his <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>profeſſion,</hi> is his <hi>Crowne.</hi> It is not my interpretation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. To the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Hold faſt that thou haſt, that none take away thy Crowne.</hi> It is our <hi>glory,</hi> and our <hi>Crowne,</hi> our <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>profeſſion.</hi> Such a <hi>Crowne</hi> we have in <hi>this</hi> World; but that is not <hi>the</hi> Crowne. Nay, beſides, there is <hi>another</hi> Crowne that every man hath, that <hi>endureth</hi> tribulation, his very <hi>ſuffering</hi> is the <hi>Crowne.</hi> As he ſaid of the Martyrs, as many <hi>ſufferings</hi> as they have, they are <hi>Crownes</hi> that God ſets on us. What Crowne ſayth <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luciota?</hi> A moſt <hi>glorious</hi> Crowne, a Crowne of <hi>Thornes:</hi> a Crowne of <hi>Thornes</hi> is more glorious then a Crowne of <hi>Gold,</hi> becauſe it makes Chriſt have <hi>fellowſhip</hi> in our <hi>death. Crownes</hi> they have <hi>here,</hi> but ſpeaking of <hi>that</hi> Crowne of <hi>immortall</hi> life, that is not to be had <hi>here,</hi> here it is a Crowne <hi>laid up, From henceforth is laid up a Crowne,</hi> but there it is a Crowne <hi>ſet on.</hi> That was the Motto of the Emperour, when he had <hi>one</hi> Crowne upon the <hi>Sword,</hi> and the other Crowne was on his <hi>head, Tertiam in Caelis.</hi> The Saints may have the Crowne of <hi>Tribulation</hi> here, but the <hi>other</hi> Crowne, the Crowne of <hi>life,</hi> that is for <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> World. As one that had three Crownes, my hope (ſaith he) ſhall be in the <hi>everlaſting</hi> Crowne: So the Saints have, they have <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> here, but their hope
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:114893:132"/>is in the <hi>Crowne of life.</hi> It is called the Crowne of <hi>life,</hi> becauſe it is given not in <hi>this</hi> life, but that Crowne is ſet on in the life to <hi>come,</hi> which is the <hi>true</hi> life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſo called: So you ſee the reaſon of the word.</p>
                  <p>And it is not the <hi>onely</hi> name that is given to <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe</hi> in Scripture, there are other names, the <hi>White lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> the <hi>Robe of righteouſneſſe,</hi> the <hi>hidden Manna,</hi> the <hi>Supper of the Lamb,</hi> the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> and <hi>Banquet</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> it is called the <hi>Kingdome of God,</hi> the <hi>Crowne of immortallity;</hi> as well as the <hi>Crowne of life.</hi> Even under the notion of a Crowne it hath many names, <hi>The Crowne of righteouſneſſe,</hi> in one place, <hi>A Crowne of STARRS,</hi> in another; the <hi>Crowne of immortallity,</hi> in a third: The <hi>Crowne of glory,</hi> in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> And in this place, St. <hi>James</hi> anticipates, the firſt from whom this word fell was from St. <hi>James, The Crowne of life.</hi> A word that a man would never have thought of; there may be a <hi>Crowne</hi> given in <hi>life,</hi> but what is the <hi>Crowne,</hi> when <hi>life</hi> is the <hi>Crowne,</hi> the <hi>place,</hi> the <hi>bliſs,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> comforts? It dropt firſt from St. <hi>James</hi> his bleſſed Pen, guided by the ſpirit, he adds this name. There are <hi>variety</hi> of names, and it <hi>muſt</hi> needs be ſo, that there muſt be <hi>variety</hi> of names.</p>
                  <p>One reaſon is this, becauſe the glory of <hi>Heaven</hi> is ſo <hi>great,</hi> that no <hi>one</hi> ſimilitude, nor <hi>two,</hi> nor <hi>ten,</hi> nor a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> can expreſſe it to the full.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is, becauſe men are of <hi>various deſires,</hi> all deſire not <hi>one thing.</hi> God will ſatisfie every mans deſire, after a ſpirituall manner.

To ſum up the point, there is an Emphaſis in both words. The <hi>crowne</hi> of <hi>life.</hi> Take them together, it is thus much.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>crowne</hi> of life, that is, there is <hi>true</hi> honour in Heaven. There is a <hi>ſhaddow</hi> of honour, and <hi>fading</hi> glory in Earth; there is none, but that which is ſolid, and ſubſtantiall there, here it is but as the cracking of <hi>thorns,</hi> as holy <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of the <hi>joy</hi> of the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> is <hi>ſhort,</hi> it is but for a <hi>moment,</hi> it is but a <hi>ſhaddow,</hi> in the beſt interpretation; it is <hi>ſubſtantiall, ſolid,</hi> glory and honour, in Heaven. That you may ſee it is ſubſtantiall, it is called a <hi>crowne,</hi> as if it were <hi>maſſie,</hi> and <hi>ponderous,</hi> it is maſſie, ſubſtantiall glory. That you may ſee it is maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ſubſtantiall, what a word doth the Apoſtle uſe! <hi>The weight of glory,</hi> the <hi>exceeding, eternall weight of glory.</hi> It is a Crowne: that is one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Crowne of <hi>life, Honor maximus, &amp;c.</hi> It is the greateſt <hi>honour,</hi> there is nothing <hi>higher</hi> in the eſtimation, and in the admiration of men, then a <hi>crowne:</hi> it is the <hi>higheſt</hi> appendant of <hi>Majeſty, Kings</hi> are <hi>ſupreme;</hi> thoſe that are Gods Deputies, onely accountable to God, and next to God. The glory of a King is ſo <hi>great,</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:114893:133"/>that men have hardly eyes that are great enough, but they are dazelled to look on them. Yet the Kingdomes of the <hi>World,</hi> and the glory of them are but <hi>dark</hi> and powerleſſe in reſpect of the Crownes of Heaven. There is no Crowne this World, but hath a <hi>croſſe</hi> upon it, there are <hi>Thornes</hi> in every Crowne, <hi>cares</hi> goe along with the Crowne; all is not pure glory, they <hi>watch,</hi> and are troubled in the government of them that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their charge. But theſe are Crownes of <hi>glory,</hi> and honour, of Kings without <hi>diſturbance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be <hi>croſses</hi> here in tribulations; but tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ends all here, how? Sweetly, in a Crowne, all the Saints of God are <hi>Kings,</hi> there is a <hi>Kingdome</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you; and they are not Kings, without the <hi>glory</hi> of Kings, here is the Crowne added to the Kingdome. The Crowne of a King, it is the higheſt honour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a Crowne is the honour of thoſe that <hi>ſtrive,</hi> thoſe that are put into the liſts. Crownes were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, alwaies of <hi>Conquerours,</hi> as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith very well, the <hi>Crowne</hi> is the reward of <hi>victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, all the Saints have the Crowne promiſed, but above all, thoſe that endure <hi>Tribulation,</hi> have the promiſe of it more properly; becauſe they are brought to the <hi>ſtrife,</hi> to the <hi>fight</hi> of faith. It is drawne from the cuſtome of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> they in all their <hi>Olympicks,</hi> the great Spectacles they made in the view of all the world, ſtill there were <hi>cups,</hi> and <hi>garments,</hi> and Crownes, that were the rewards of the Conquerours. And yet ſo poor they were, that if a <hi>Horſe</hi> did but run a race, and <hi>won,</hi> he had a <hi>crowne,</hi> or a <hi>cup.</hi> And thereupon <hi>Theocritus</hi> ſayth, ſee what poore things the <hi>World</hi> glories in, that bruit-<hi>Beaſts</hi> are taken with; their Conquerours are Crowned, ſo are their <hi>Horſes.</hi> But ſee what Crownes theſe are, not Crownes of <hi>Ivie,</hi> and <hi>Lawrell,</hi> but made out of the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:114893:133"/>Tree of <hi>life,</hi> not a <hi>cup</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> but of <hi>Salvation.</hi> It is the <hi>wreath</hi> of <hi>Lawrell</hi> that never <hi>withers,</hi> the Crowne that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>fades,</hi> the Crowne of <hi>life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle might have as eaſily expreſt it, &amp; ſaid, for when he is tried he ſhall reap <hi>Heaven,</hi> he ſhal be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, here had been a round &amp; proper expreſſion. No, it is not ſo proper, becauſe he had mentioned <hi>tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> before, he ſuits it with a word anſwerable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having ſpoken of <hi>Strivers,</hi> he adds the reward, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that endure <hi>tribulation,</hi> they ſhall have the <hi>Crowne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Crowne of life is an honour, a <hi>laſting</hi> honour, for the Crowne of life, is as much as a <hi>Living</hi> Crowne. Who ever ſaw a <hi>living Crowne?</hi> They be in Heaven, <hi>living</hi> Crownes, that is, <hi>laſting</hi> Crownes, that ſhall not be ſet upon the <hi>head,</hi> but the <hi>heart.</hi> Crownes are for the <hi>head</hi> in the World, it is the higheſt place, and therefore being the higheſt place, is moſt <hi>conſpicuous.</hi> But the Crowne of life, it is ſet on the heart, the ſeat of <hi>life.</hi> What is that Crowne, that is not ſet on the <hi>head,</hi> but on the <hi>Soul,</hi> and on the <hi>whole</hi> man? O her Crownes are but Ornaments for the <hi>head,</hi> this for all the body, it ſhall be all <hi>Crownes,</hi> whatſoever is upon the body glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or the ſoul, it ſhall be all <hi>glorious,</hi> it ſhall be all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and glory and <hi>bliſs,</hi> is but the <hi>Crowne.</hi> The ſame that the <hi>beatitude</hi> is, that is the Crowne, but as it is here, it is a <hi>living</hi> Crowne.</p>
                  <p>It is true, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that upon the Elders <hi>heads</hi> he ſaw Crownes of <hi>Gold.</hi> One ſpeciall reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Gold</hi> is a thing all <hi>deſire,</hi> and long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: he meets with men in their owne deſires, becauſe every man deſires <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Crownes,</hi> he tells us where we ſhall have <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Crownes</hi> both, but it is in <hi>Heaven.</hi> But on the other ſide, leaſt we ſhould think that he
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:114893:134"/>ſpake <hi>properly,</hi> and that there were any thing in Heaven ſo <hi>poore,</hi> and ſo <hi>baſe,</hi> as <hi>Gold,</hi> that which he there calls Crownes of <hi>Gold,</hi> he calls in Chap. 2. the Crowne of <hi>life,</hi> I, that is ſpirituall, to let us ſee that they are Crownes of <hi>Gold,</hi> but in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> manner: for the ſame that is the Crowne of <hi>immortality,</hi> the Crowne of <hi>Starrs,</hi> the Crowne of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> is the Crowne of <hi>life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this that it is ſaid to be the Crowne of life, it hath not the luſtre of <hi>one</hi> Crowne, but the glory of all <hi>Starrs,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>immortality,</hi> all are in the Crowne of <hi>life,</hi> you ſee now, what a riſe here is; theſe are the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes when God raiſeth. Who is more on the Dunghill then an <hi>afflicted</hi> Creature? What a riſe is here, for duſt and aſhes to be raiſed to the glory of <hi>Heaven?</hi> For a man in <hi>tribulation</hi> to be raiſed to the ſtate of a <hi>King,</hi> the glory of a <hi>Crowne?</hi> As the Apoſtles, and Diſciples ſayd, <hi>Did not our hearts burne?</hi> Doe not your hearts <hi>leape</hi> to think of a <hi>Crowne?</hi> How impoſſible is it for any man that is <hi>ambitious,</hi> to reach honour of <hi>leſs</hi> matters then a <hi>Crowne,</hi> but it is for thoſe that it belongs to, and that God hath <hi>appointed?</hi> And yet how eaſily may we attain a Crowne that is <hi>more</hi> glorious in <hi>Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this a great <hi>excitement,</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> for men <hi>patiently</hi> to ſuffer <hi>tribulation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Admit the tribulation be ſharp, here is that that will <hi>allay</hi> it, the <hi>tribulation</hi> is <hi>ſharp,</hi> but the <hi>crowne</hi> is <hi>glorious,</hi> Feare not, though the tribulation be <hi>bitter, Dum paſſio, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayth well, while the tribulation is <hi>ſift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>winnowing,</hi> the Crowne is <hi>preparing,</hi> and God is <hi>ſending.</hi> There is nothing that is <hi>excellent,</hi> but it comes with difficulty; if then we be content to take things that are <hi>excellent</hi> in this World, with <hi>labour,</hi> and <hi>paines,</hi> and <hi>coſt,</hi> and <hi>difficulty,</hi> ſhall we not beſtow a little paines to goe through difficulty for <hi>Heaven?</hi> It is but <hi>ſmall</hi>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:114893:134"/>ſtraits that we are to goe through for Heaven; it is but a <hi>little</hi> tribulation that is <hi>prepared</hi> before it be ſent, and <hi>fitted</hi> when it is ſent, if it be ſharp, the Crowne is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, admit the afflictions be many, as they be ſharp, as the <hi>ſufferings</hi> are many, ſo the <hi>rewards,</hi> and Crowns are <hi>many:</hi> Every perticular <hi>ſuffering</hi> hath a Crowne; every perticular <hi>grace</hi> hath the promiſe of a Crowne, if there be ſeverall Crownes, a Crowne of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and a Crowne of <hi>Starrs,</hi> a Crowne of <hi>glory,</hi> a Crowne of <hi>immortality,</hi> a Crowne of <hi>life;</hi> then feare not, but God is able to make the Crownes anſwerable to the number of your <hi>paſſions.</hi> And by how much mens <hi>ſufferings</hi> have beene greater, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayth well, by ſo much the more, the Crowne ſhall be more <hi>bright,</hi> and <hi>ſplendent,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayth well, every Saint that God the more <hi>buffets,</hi> and conflicts he hath endur'd, the greater ſhall be his <hi>reward,</hi> and more ample of glory. This for the multitude of tribulations, if they be many.</p>
                  <p>Admit in the laſt place, that tribulations and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be long, though there be nothing long in this World, there is nothing long, that comes to a <hi>period:</hi> for there is nothing long that is <hi>temporary.</hi> All <hi>tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>ſufferings,</hi> are temporary: That is too much to ſay, they are temporary, they are all <hi>momentary,</hi> that is leſſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth ſo, that which is momentary, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>long.</hi> What is ſhorter then a <hi>moment?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was able to judge, he endured <hi>many,</hi> and <hi>long</hi> tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But our life is but a <hi>moment</hi> to <hi>eternity,</hi> our life is but as yeſterday, ſayth the Pſalmiſt, they can laſt but <hi>this</hi> life, and that may no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> laſt to the next moment. They are <hi>temporary,</hi> nay, they are <hi>momentary,</hi> admit they were not, yet that Crowne will recompence it, the Crowne of life is <hi>immortall,</hi> here is that that will recompence it.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:114893:135"/>You know the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of this world are but momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (as I ſaid) and yet worldly men take a great deale of pains to <hi>decline</hi> them. On the other ſide, the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of the world are <hi>momentaine,</hi> &amp; what pains doe worldly men take to <hi>enjoy</hi> them? how much trouble is there? and what care doe they take to heale a <hi>finger,</hi> if it be out of frame, or out of joint? or for the curing of any part of the body, if there be but any paſſion upon that? nay further, not onely the care of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> but what a great deale of care doe worldly men take, to fulfill their <hi>luſts?</hi> How much will wicked men ſuffer to enjoy their <hi>luſts?</hi> what will they not ſuffer? then, as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſtirred up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to follow his ſtudie the more earneſtly, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a <hi>Smith</hi> that was at his <hi>work</hi> before he was at his <hi>ſtudy;</hi> it is a ſhame for me ſaith he, to be in <hi>bed,</hi> and the <hi>Smith</hi> to be at <hi>work;</hi> this was <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> argument, ſo it may for Chriſtians, ſhall <hi>wicked</hi> men <hi>endure</hi> ſo much to fullfill the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> and ſhall not we <hi>endure</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to attain the <hi>Crowne</hi> of life, and <hi>immortallity,</hi> for the attaining of <hi>heaven? Si tanta,</hi> &amp;c. If the ſoul, ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> he content to ſuffer ſo much, to enjoy things that are made to <hi>periſh,</hi> how much ſhould we be content to ſuffer for that that <hi>cannot</hi> periſh? If men will ſuffer ſo much for the <hi>fleſh,</hi> what ſhould we ſuffer for the <hi>immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the ſoul? for the <hi>gaining</hi> of <hi>Heaven?</hi> for the <hi>crown?</hi> It was the argument of the devout <hi>Hermite,</hi> when he ſaw a <hi>Harlot</hi> ſpend ſome hours in attiring of her ſelf, he fell bitterly on weeping; being aſked what was the reaſon? Saith he, becauſe I cannot beſtow ſo <hi>earneſt</hi> pains in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring my <hi>ſoul,</hi> as that creature doth, in decking of her body; that was his argument. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> he gives ſuch an argument, whereas <hi>worldly</hi> men ſtrive for a <hi>corruptible</hi> Crowne, ſhall not we ſtrive for that which is <hi>incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> Shall not the children of <hi>light</hi> be as zealous for <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as the children of the world are for <hi>pleaſures?</hi> Shall

For, firſt if you mark it, he moderates the <hi>quantity</hi> with the <hi>quality, theſe light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</hi> Then againe he moderates the <hi>quality</hi> with the <hi>quantity,</hi> they are <hi>ſhort</hi> afflictions, if they be <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> they are <hi>ſhort,</hi> and <hi>momentaine:</hi> then he <hi>moderates both</hi> with the <hi>compariſons</hi> that follow, <hi>light</hi> afflictions, but a <hi>weight</hi> of glory; <hi>momentaine</hi> afflictions, but an <hi>eternall</hi> weight of glory. And this <hi>eternall</hi> weight of glory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in <hi>quality,</hi> and <hi>quantity,</hi> St <hi>Paul</hi> would not have us think his afflictions <hi>long,</hi> and <hi>ſharp,</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> they are nothing ſo that God ſends, but if they were ſo, ſhall we not endure them?

                  <p>So I have done with the firſt, here is the <hi>Modus,</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> of diſpenſation, Gods free gift on our <hi>ſufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next is the <hi>Tempus,</hi> the time of this reception.</p>
                  <q>When he is tried.</q>
                  <p>Then he ſhall receive, when he is <hi>tried.</hi> The word is well interpoſed, there are in it two things.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>a liquid ſuppoſitum,</hi> ſomething <hi>ſuppoſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is <hi>a liquid poſitum,</hi> ſomething <hi>expreſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thing <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> is this, the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>temptation,</hi> and <hi>tribulation</hi> is for <hi>triall. When he is tried,</hi> when he hath <hi>endured</hi> tribulation, when he is <hi>tried. Tribulation</hi> is ſent for <hi>proofe,</hi> and <hi>triall.</hi> Therefore though it be tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and affliction that is ſpoken of, it is called <hi>tentation.</hi> We may well give the reaſon out of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome: Tribulation</hi> is well called <hi>temptation,</hi> becauſe it is for the <hi>triall</hi> of our <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> for the triall of the graces that God hath given us, the very word <hi>temptation</hi> betokens <hi>triall;</hi> therefore it is that the Schoolmen give that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of it. <hi>Temptation</hi> is nothing elſe but, <hi>Explora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio per experientiam,</hi> as <hi>Pariſienſis,</hi> temptation is a taking <hi>triall</hi> by experience, they are <hi>Aquinas</hi> words, becauſe the <hi>best</hi> knowledge is that that comes by <hi>experience,</hi> and the beſt experience is that upon taking of <hi>tryall. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> that is upon triall, as <hi>Gallen</hi> ſpeaks, is the <hi>beſt</hi> way of cognizance that we can have for the nature of any thing whatſoever. Therefore becauſe all <hi>temptation</hi> aimes at diſcovery and <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>triall,</hi> therefore this word of triall is called <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> though it be the temptations of <hi>ſuggeſtion,</hi> or of <hi>proving,</hi> there are diverſe kinds of eyther of theſe ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Of ill Temptations of <hi>Suggeſtion,</hi> there are <hi>three.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Satan</hi> tempts <hi>men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>good</hi> there are <hi>two.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Men</hi> tempt, and <hi>prove themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God tempts and proves <hi>men</hi> by ſending <hi>afflictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the end of all theſe whither <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> it is ſtill <hi>tryall,</hi> tryall is the end of all.</p>
                  <p>If we ſpeake of ill temptations; if <hi>one</hi> man tempt <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> the <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> and <hi>allurements</hi> that are uſed, are firſt by feeling his <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> how he is <hi>inclined,</hi> which way he may be <hi>moved,</hi> by taking <hi>meaſure</hi> of the <hi>foote</hi> of his affections, ſeeing which way his affections work that he may draw him. <hi>Triall</hi> is the end of <hi>that</hi> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>If it be the temptations of <hi>Satan,</hi> he never tempts, but for <hi>triall,</hi> if he knew what were in us, he would not <hi>tempt,</hi> he would convey it <hi>without</hi> temptation, there needed no <hi>ſuggeſtion:</hi> But becauſe he knowes not what is in man (though he can give a ſhrewd gueſſe by the working of the mind, and <hi>fancie,</hi> and ſences,) therefore he makes <hi>triall,</hi> he offers temptations to the <hi>phanſie,</hi> and to the <hi>ſences,</hi> to ſee how they ſtand affected to ſuch <hi>ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,</hi> as he will inſinuate.</p>
                  <p>And his <hi>wayes</hi> of <hi>triall</hi> are <hi>many,</hi> he hath his ſeverall wayes of experimentall <hi>trialls,</hi> for <hi>every</hi> action that we are converſant about, and for <hi>every condition.</hi> If a man <hi>abound</hi> with the <hi>bleſſings</hi> of God, he hath wayes of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for that, to <hi>try</hi> whither he can bring him to pride.</p>
                  <p>If he be in <hi>poverty,</hi> he hath temptations for that, (and they are for triall ſtill he proves him to bring him to <hi>diffidence,</hi> and <hi>murmuring,</hi> and <hi>repining.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:114893:142"/>
                  <p>If it be any <hi>good</hi> that we doe, he tries whither our hearts be of ſuch a temper, that we may be brought to think it is of our <hi>ſelves.</hi> If it be any <hi>ill,</hi> he tries if he can gaine force upon our hearts, that we may goe on in <hi>impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> His temptations are like the wind that is ſpoken of in <hi>Job,</hi> that beat the houſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> Children in all the <hi>foure</hi> quarters of it; he can ſet upon the heart in all the quarters of it. Sometimes he will convey himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Cabinet</hi> and Cloſet of our <hi>affections;</hi> ſometimes he knocks at the <hi>Gate</hi> of the <hi>Sences;</hi> Sometimes he will feele the <hi>pulſe</hi> of the <hi>Phanſie:</hi> Sometimes he is <hi>above</hi> to tempt to <hi>pride,</hi> ſometimes he is below, to tempt to <hi>deſpaire.</hi> If he be before us, it is to hinder us in the <hi>good</hi> we are about; if <hi>behind</hi> us, it is to pull us <hi>back</hi> againe by relapſing into ſins that we have <hi>forſaken,</hi> and repented of. If he be on the <hi>right</hi> hand, or on the <hi>left,</hi> ſtill he hath <hi>trialls</hi> for both, to turne us out of the way: and the end of all his temptations is ſtill <hi>tryall.</hi> Firſt, he <hi>tries</hi> how our <hi>conſtitution</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> ſtands; and then when he hath got that, then he tries how we will take the bait againe. Even the <hi>Devills</hi> temptations are for <hi>tryall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, if we ſpeake of thoſe wherewith <hi>men</hi> are ſaid to tempt <hi>God.</hi> Men are ſaid to tempt God many wayes, when they <hi>murmur,</hi> and <hi>repine</hi> at his dealing. When they <hi>doubt</hi> and <hi>diſtruſt</hi> God for any attribute, his <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>wiſdome,</hi> or <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> or <hi>mercy.</hi> When out of <hi>curioſity</hi> they labour to <hi>ſearch,</hi> whither he be ſo <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> as the Scripture tells us. Men will be <hi>curious,</hi> and <hi>buſie</hi> to <hi>prie</hi> into Gods attributes; and ſtill when they <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>ſearch</hi> to ſatisfie themſelves by tempting of God theſe wayes, it is for triall, that we may prove whither he be ſo, or no. As the <hi>Phariſees</hi> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſt, becauſe they did not know that he was the Son of God. Satan himſelfe tempted him, becauſe he
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:114893:142"/>did but <hi>ſuſpect</hi> then that he was the Son of God, it was for <hi>triall; evill</hi> temptations are for <hi>triall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo are <hi>good</hi> too, there are <hi>good</hi> temptations of <hi>proofe,</hi> whereby <hi>men</hi> prove themſelves. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls that by the name of <hi>temptation. Prove,</hi> or <hi>try,</hi> or <hi>tempt your ſelves, whither you be in the faith, or no: know you not your owne ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. When a man makes <hi>inſpection</hi> into his owne heart, to find out how his <hi>eſtate</hi> ſtands, how he <hi>thrives</hi> in grace, whither he <hi>decline,</hi> or no, when he <hi>proves</hi> every grace, and brings it to the <hi>Touch</hi> ſtone; here he <hi>proves,</hi> and tries his <hi>owne</hi> heart, he makes triall of his <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> of his <hi>faith,</hi> of his <hi>patience,</hi> of his <hi>love</hi> to God, of his <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> of his <hi>repentance,</hi> of his <hi>growth</hi> in all. Theſe temptations to <hi>good,</hi> are <hi>trialls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, to bring it to the point, the good tryalls wherewith God is ſaid to tempt men, God <hi>tempts,</hi> and <hi>tries</hi> to ſee whither we will love him with <hi>all our hearts,</hi> or no, <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to tempt men principally by tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are therefore called trialls. But he hath many other wayes of <hi>prooving; every</hi> way whereby he reveales himſelfe, is a way of <hi>triall.</hi> He hath as many wayes of <hi>tryall,</hi> as he hath wayes of revealing himſelfe. If he give us his <hi>word,</hi> it is for <hi>tryall</hi> to prove whither we will bring forth <hi>fruit.</hi> If he <hi>take</hi> away his word, it is for <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> to ſee how we will walk in the <hi>graces</hi> that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us. If he <hi>multiply</hi> bleſſings, it is for <hi>tryall,</hi> to ſee how <hi>thankfull</hi> we will be, and whither we will be drawn by the <hi>faire</hi> way of invitation, by <hi>mercies:</hi> If he <hi>take</hi> away his <hi>bleſſings,</hi> and multiply his afflictions, it is for <hi>tryall</hi> ſtill, to ſee how we will beare our ſelves, under the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and take his chaſtiſement. Every way that he reveales himſelfe, whither he ſend <hi>afflictions</hi> or <hi>remove afflictions,</hi> whither he <hi>ſend</hi> bleſſing, or take <hi>away</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, all are for triall. Sometimes for the triall of <hi>one</hi>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:114893:143"/>grace, ſometimes for the triall of <hi>another.</hi> Sometimes for the triall of <hi>obedience. Exod.</hi> 26. <hi>The Lord your God proved, and tempted you, to ſee whither you would walk in his Commandements, or no.</hi> Sometimes for the tryall of our love, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. <hi>The Lord your God prooved you, to ſee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would love him withall your hearts.</hi> And ſo for all, for every grace he ſends a <hi>tryall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we muſt underſtand, that God doth not ſo prove for triall, as men doe. We take a <hi>tryall</hi> of things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are <hi>ignorant,</hi> we doe not know them ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; God therefore <hi>tries</hi> us, becauſe he knowes us; not that he may have <hi>better</hi> knowledge of us, as we take <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> No, God will take <hi>tryal</hi> of that he knows <hi>already,</hi> or that he knows <hi>fully.</hi> With <hi>men</hi> every trial is taken <hi>either</hi> for the <hi>gaining,</hi> or for the <hi>bettering</hi> of <hi>knowledge.</hi> God, that knowes <hi>all</hi> things, and that <hi>Searcheth the heart,</hi> ſees what is in us, he <hi>diſcernes our thoughts long before.</hi> There is not a word in our tongues, not the leaſt <hi>motion</hi> in our <hi>hearts,</hi> but he <hi>knows</hi> it, he needs not take a <hi>triall</hi> for his <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> to <hi>gaine</hi> knowledge, or to <hi>better</hi> his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; he knows us <hi>better</hi> then our ſelves. But there are two reaſons why God makes theſe trialls.</p>
                  <p>One reaſon is given by St. <hi>Jerome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other by St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One reaſon of his trialls is, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſayth, not that <hi>he</hi> may <hi>know</hi> what is in us, but that he may make <hi>others</hi> know; otherwiſe the <hi>luſtre,</hi> and <hi>light</hi> of that grace that God hath given, if God ſhould not make it <hi>ſhine</hi> out by taking a <hi>tryall,</hi> it could not bring <hi>glory</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> if it were not <hi>exemplary</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> the <hi>tryall</hi> of grace makes it <hi>ſhine.</hi> He deales with us as <hi>Rupurtus</hi> ſayth, as a Merchant of Small-wares, a Pedlar doth with his Pack: He <hi>knows</hi> all that is in his Pack, but when he comes where Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are, he <hi>rifles,</hi> and <hi>layes</hi> out all; not that <hi>he</hi> may <hi>know,</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:114893:143"/>but that <hi>others</hi> may <hi>know,</hi> and be invited to <hi>buy.</hi> So God knowes the furniſhing of the heart, the <hi>graces</hi> that are there, but he rifles them, and layes them <hi>open</hi> by tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that <hi>others</hi> may ſee the diſtinction betweene <hi>this</hi> grace, and <hi>that,</hi> that they ſeeing it, may give God the <hi>glory.</hi> Not that <hi>he</hi> may know, but that <hi>others</hi> may know. That is one reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Another Reaſon why he <hi>tempts,</hi> and <hi>prooves,</hi> and makes <hi>tryall, Non ut ipſe,</hi> &amp;c. not that <hi>he</hi> may find what is in man, but that <hi>man</hi> may find what is in <hi>himſelfe;</hi> we are all ſtrangers to our ſelves. <hi>No man knoweth the things of a man, but the Spirit that is in man,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle. Nay, we may goe a little further. The things of a man knowes not man <hi>himſelfe.</hi> It is not all that is in man that can goe to the <hi>windings,</hi> and <hi>turnings,</hi> and <hi>Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes</hi> of the heart, there are ſo many <hi>partitions,</hi> and ſtarting-holes, that man <hi>himſelfe</hi> cannot find them. We know not the <hi>weight</hi> of our <hi>graces,</hi> nor the <hi>depth</hi> of our <hi>infirmities</hi> and <hi>Errours, God</hi> it is that muſt diſcover them; and how doth he lay them <hi>open?</hi> By <hi>tryalls,</hi> and <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>tribulations;</hi> there he lets us ſee our <hi>infirmities,</hi> and <hi>ſinfullneſſe;</hi> it is as a <hi>Glaſſe</hi> to let us ſee our <hi>infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> on the one ſide, and as a <hi>glaſſe</hi> to ſee the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>We could not know the <hi>meaſure</hi> of our <hi>graces,</hi> but for <hi>trialls</hi> how much <hi>patience</hi> we have, and how much <hi>faith,</hi> and how much <hi>love,</hi> and how much <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> nor <hi>any</hi> grace, a man would never be able to take the true weight of it, unleſſe it were thus <hi>diſcovered</hi> to him, and by theſe <hi>trialls.</hi> Therefore he tries us, that he may diſcover our hearts to our <hi>ſelves,</hi> to make us ſee what he hath done for us; to make us ſee what we <hi>were,</hi> what we are, and what we <hi>may</hi> be, all this is by <hi>triall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As a Father deales thus with his <hi>Child,</hi> he takes the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:114893:144"/>Childs <hi>finger</hi> and puts it to the <hi>flame</hi> of the Candle, or the flame of the <hi>fire,</hi> and bids him <hi>proove</hi> if it be hot. Not but that the <hi>Father knowes,</hi> but that the <hi>Child is ignorant,</hi> that he may learne to <hi>ſhun</hi> it. So God deales in theſe <hi>Trialls,</hi> he ſuffers us to be brought under the flame of <hi>Tribulation,</hi> to be put into the <hi>Furnace</hi> of <hi>afflictions,</hi> he puts our finger into the flame, that we may learne to know that the fire is <hi>hot,</hi> and how hot the fire is that we <hi>deſerve,</hi> and had had if Chriſt had not come, he brings us that he may make us know it.</p>
                  <p>So, ſum it up now, and then you have the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>all</hi> kind of <hi>temptations,</hi> eſpecially theſe of <hi>tribulation,</hi> they are for <hi>triall.</hi> If that be the end, there is no reaſon we ſhould be out of love with <hi>Gods</hi> chaſtiſements. Were the end <hi>evill,</hi> we had cauſe to feare, and to <hi>murmur</hi> at <hi>tribulations;</hi> but the end is for <hi>good,</hi> and the <hi>beſt</hi> good of all, to bring us nearer to <hi>Heaven,</hi> to <hi>indeare</hi> us more to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>weane</hi> us more from the <hi>World,</hi> to make us better to underſtand <hi>God,</hi> and our ſelves, fort he <hi>polliſhment</hi> of thoſe <hi>graces</hi> that God hath given us, for the <hi>attaining</hi> of thoſe <hi>graces</hi> that yet we <hi>want,</hi> and for the <hi>perfecting</hi> of <hi>all.</hi> For the <hi>polliſhing</hi> of grace, and <hi>refining</hi> it, that is one end.</p>
                  <p>Were it ſo, that we were <hi>all grace,</hi> and <hi>all ſpirit,</hi> there would be no <hi>triall</hi> then. There are <hi>two</hi> conditions of mettalls in which there needs not any triall of the <hi>fire.</hi> One is, if it be <hi>all gold,</hi> another is, if it be <hi>all droſſe.</hi> If it be <hi>all gold,</hi> it needs no <hi>purifying,</hi> if it be <hi>all droſſe,</hi> it will not <hi>endure</hi> it, it is not worthy the <hi>fire.</hi> So it is with Chriſtians, were we in the World <hi>all gold,</hi> or <hi>all droſſe;</hi> there would be no <hi>triall,</hi> if we were all <hi>pure</hi> mettall, all <hi>Gold.</hi> Tribulation, and <hi>trialls</hi> are ſuperfluous in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> where the Saints <hi>enjoy</hi> happineſſe, and are all pure <hi>Gold,</hi> there is no triall there, there is no <hi>ſuffering,</hi> all is
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:114893:144"/>
                     <hi>Gold</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi> On the other ſide, were we all <hi>droſſe</hi> that there were no ſpirit at all, nothing of <hi>grace,</hi> then there would not be the <hi>refining</hi> triall: for <hi>chaffe,</hi> and <hi>ſtubble,</hi> and <hi>droſſe,</hi> are not purified by the fire, but <hi>conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> annihillate, and brought to nothing. But ſince our eſtate is ſo, (as we are all in this condition of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality) that we are <hi>part</hi> Gold, and <hi>part</hi> Clay; <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as well as <hi>Spirit,</hi> and there is a <hi>mixture</hi> of both, thereupon for the <hi>purging</hi> away of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and for the <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that muſt be brought to the <hi>Touch-ſtone,</hi> by the fierie <hi>triall</hi> of tribulation, that the <hi>graces</hi> may be <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and the <hi>droſſe conſumed,</hi> and burnt up. Therefore let this be the concluſion.</p>
                  <p>You that ſo much <hi>love</hi> the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of the World, that are ſo afraid to <hi>heare</hi> of any day of <hi>tribulation;</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he that hath called us to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us to the <hi>Croſſe;</hi> and the <hi>firſt</hi> leſſon that he reads to us, is to take <hi>grace</hi> with all <hi>diſadvantages.</hi> Never look that God will give us <hi>grace,</hi> but make ſure of <hi>affliction.</hi> He gives not <hi>grace</hi> for <hi>nothing;</hi> would you have him give <hi>grace,</hi> and not get the <hi>glory</hi> of it? How ſhould he get the glory of it, but by tryall? How ſhould he have the glory of <hi>patience,</hi> but for <hi>affliction?</hi> Or the glory of <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> or of pure <hi>love,</hi> but when his Servants <hi>love</hi> him moſt, when his countenance is moſt <hi>clouded</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them? Their <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> and <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> when is it ſeene? In <hi>tribulation.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as our bleſſed Saviour ſaid, concerning the <hi>Croſſe</hi> that Chriſtians when they are called, muſt looke for. They ſhall receive in <hi>this life an hundred fold with tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Be pleaſed to mark the place, <hi>He that forſakes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Mother, or Houſe, or Land, ſhall receive an hundred fold in this life.</hi> How? That cannot be in <hi>temporalls,</hi> it muſt be in <hi>ſpiritualls,</hi> becauſe <hi>one</hi> dram of <hi>grace</hi> is a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:114893:145"/>fold,</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>temporalls.</hi> Shall we receive an <hi>hundred</hi> fold, that is, <hi>ſpirituall</hi> abundance? What followes? <hi>With tribulation,</hi> with <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>tryalls.</hi> If God give a <hi>hundred fold</hi> in <hi>ſpiritualls,</hi> it is with <hi>tryalls.</hi> No man puts <hi>Armour</hi> upon another, but for <hi>fight;</hi> the <hi>graces</hi> of the ſpirit are the <hi>Armour</hi> of Chriſtians. <hi>Take unto you the Armour of God,</hi> VVhat? <hi>The ſheild of faith, the Helmet of Salvation, the Breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe, the Sword of the Spirit.</hi> All grace is <hi>Armour,</hi> if God put ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>Armour</hi> on Chriſtians, they muſt looke for a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> when their Armour is on. Grace is Armour, we muſt look for the <hi>triall</hi> of it; for the <hi>end</hi> of all <hi>tribulation</hi> is <hi>triall,</hi> and the end of all <hi>grace</hi> that God gives. Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with grace upon any ſeeming <hi>diſadvantage,</hi> it will bring abundance of advantage after. That is the firſt, the thing <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> here, <hi>When he is tried,</hi> he muſt <hi>look</hi> to be <hi>tryed.</hi> The <hi>end</hi> why God ſends <hi>tribulations,</hi> and <hi>temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> is for <hi>tryall,</hi> that is the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The next is the thing here expounded or expreſt and plainly ſet downe, that is the <hi>time; when he is tried,</hi> then he <hi>ſhall receive.</hi> The Apoſtle adds this to prevent a Queſtion, having made mention of that that makes all hearts <hi>leap</hi> after the fruition of it, the <hi>Crowne of life.</hi> If any man ſhould ask, as the Diſciples did of Chriſt, <hi>O Lord when ſhall theſe things be?</hi> Bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>when</hi> ſhall this <hi>Crowne</hi> of life be?</p>
                  <p>For this Queſtion it had beene a ſufficient anſwer, <hi>In due ſeaſon you ſhall reape if you faint not:</hi> In <hi>due</hi> ſeaſon you ſhall have it; the <hi>time</hi> ſhall come, think it not <hi>long;</hi> but that is too <hi>generall.</hi> Then he drawes it downe more <hi>perticularly</hi> a little: Would you know <hi>when?</hi> I will tell you, when <hi>tribulation</hi> is ended, when the <hi>triall</hi> is fully <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;</hi> when God hath ſufficiently <hi>refined</hi> you, and <hi>fitted</hi> you for Heaven, and made you as he would have you
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:114893:145"/>to be, when you are <hi>tried.</hi> But tell us more perticular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when ſhall this be? After <hi>one</hi> tribulation? It may be not. It is with many of us, as <hi>Florus</hi> ſayth of the <hi>Gaules</hi> at the <hi>firſt</hi> brunt they would be <hi>ſtout,</hi> and play the <hi>men</hi> more then men, at the <hi>ſecond</hi> they would grow <hi>feeble.</hi> So many Chriſtians it may be will endure <hi>one</hi> courſe of tribulation, and temptation, and endure <hi>ſtou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore we muſt not think to have it alway after <hi>one</hi> tribulation; <hi>one</hi> tribulation is but a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> or preparative to <hi>another;</hi> when God hath <hi>fitted</hi> us for <hi>one,</hi> we muſt look for <hi>more.</hi> When then, at the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> or <hi>third,</hi> or <hi>fourth,</hi> or <hi>more?</hi> No, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſets it <hi>indefinitly,</hi> becauſe he would not goe about to <hi>limit</hi> God, <hi>the holy one of Iſraell,</hi> you cannot <hi>tell,</hi> whither at <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> or <hi>foure,</hi> but in Gods <hi>beſt time,</hi> when <hi>he</hi> thinks <hi>fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi> when <hi>the triall</hi> is <hi>done,</hi> when the triall is fully <hi>made.</hi> So this word now, it is a word <hi>ſimple</hi> here ſet downe but it ſtands for a <hi>defective</hi> word, as the Scripture uſeth ſuch words oft times. <hi>When he is tried,</hi> that is thus much, when he is <hi>throughly</hi> tried, when he is <hi>approvably</hi> tried.

                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:114893:146"/>his work, and gone <hi>through</hi> the labour, till then it ſtands not with reaſon that he ſhould <hi>receive</hi> the Crowne, which way ſoever we take it.</p>
                  <p>Whither we conſider the <hi>ſufferings,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or the <hi>reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we conſider the <hi>ſufferings,</hi> admit that ſufferings be, as they are as <hi>Phyſick</hi> to the ſoul, it is not fit the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> ſhould be removed till the <hi>wound</hi> be healed; when the <hi>wound</hi> is <hi>healed,</hi> the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> will fall off. God takes not away the <hi>Phyſick</hi> of tribulation, till he hath wrought the <hi>cure,</hi> and done the work <hi>perfectly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, if we take theſe <hi>temptations,</hi> and tribulations as <hi>trialls,</hi> before he have given ſufficient <hi>proofe,</hi> he takes not away the <hi>triall:</hi> there are other graces of God <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable,</hi> as <hi>wiſdome,</hi> ſo <hi>patience,</hi> and the reſt muſt be <hi>juſtified.</hi> It is not fit that the <hi>fire</hi> of tribulation ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till the <hi>Gold</hi> be <hi>purified;</hi> then he will quench the <hi>Furnace,</hi> and <hi>take</hi> away the fire.

                  </p>
                  <p>Then if we conſider the <hi>reward,</hi> there is good reaſon conſidering the reward; Either,</p>

                  <p>Firſt, it is ſet downe to us in a <hi>generall</hi> word, which comprehends all the ſeverall branches and excellencies of that glory, by the name of <hi>bleſſedneſſe, Bleſſed is the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there is a <hi>ſpeciall</hi> word of that generall, when it is called, <hi>the Crowne of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then laſt of all, there is another <hi>ſpeciall,</hi> a more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of that ſpeciall, when it is referred to the grace of <hi>love;</hi> the <hi>Crowne of life which God hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> So this is the part that I am now to ſpeak of, which is the cloſe of the verſe. And there are two things that are obſerveable in it.</p>
                  <p>One on <hi>Gods</hi> part, it is <hi>Corona promiſſa,</hi> the Crowne <hi>promiſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another on <hi>our</hi> part, it is <hi>Corona amantium,</hi> the Crown of them that <hi>love</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the two things I am to ſpeake of.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe, the firſt branch of this laſt part of the deſcription, that hath reſpect to him that <hi>gives</hi> the glory, <hi>Corona repromiſſa,</hi> the <hi>Crowne that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi> The Apoſtle adds theſe words out of a great deale of wiſdome, and foreſight. He lets us ſee by this word that he adds here, both <hi>who</hi> is the <hi>Donor,</hi> and what is the <hi>conveyance</hi> of this excellent glory.</p>
                  <p>If you aſke about the <hi>Donor,</hi> the ſame is he that <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes,</hi> that <hi>promiſeth,</hi> that is <hi>God.</hi> He that gives us our <hi>firſt</hi> being, it is he onely that gives us our <hi>well</hi> being. The being of <hi>nature</hi> is from him, and ſo is the being of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:114893:148"/>
                     <hi>glory. Nam ille ſolus,</hi> &amp;c. (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayth very well) he onely can make man <hi>happy,</hi> that made man at the <hi>firſt.</hi> It is that that we all ſhall know <hi>one</hi> day, if we be ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to inherit it, when God tranſlates us thither, that it is <hi>Chriſts</hi> glorious <hi>hand</hi> that ſets on this Crowne. I but God will have us know it <hi>now</hi> before we come to it; therefore leaſt any man ſhould be ignorant, he doth not reſerve the <hi>knowledge,</hi> as long as he doth the <hi>thing,</hi> the <hi>thing</hi> ſhall be given <hi>then,</hi> it is <hi>promiſed now,</hi> in the meane time, it is <hi>God</hi> that hath <hi>promiſed</hi> it, it is God that <hi>gives</hi> it. That is the firſt thing that the Apoſtle implies.</p>
                  <p>Then if we look to the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>conveyance,</hi> it is in this word, it is by <hi>promiſe,</hi> it comes to us by <hi>deed,</hi> by good <hi>deed,</hi> good <hi>aſſurance.</hi> There is no better deed then that that is <hi>written</hi> by the Finger of God, and ſealed to us by the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The promiſe depends both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and upon the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> He lets us ſee therefore the <hi>conveyance</hi> in this word, that though we cannot yet come to ſee the glory of the <hi>crown</hi> in the <hi>thing,</hi> we may ſee it in the <hi>conveyance</hi> and promiſe. As he that is the <hi>Heire</hi> apparent to any great matter, but is not come to the <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> though he cannot behold the inheritance as his owne with the eye of <hi>ſence,</hi> he may with the eye of <hi>reaſon;</hi> if he cannot read it where it is <hi>Scituated,</hi> he may in his deeds and <hi>conveyances.</hi> It is all that the Saints had to ſhew for Heaven, when they were on Earth, they could ſee Heaven in the <hi>promiſe,</hi> they could ſee and read it in the <hi>conveyance. Abraham</hi> did <hi>ſee Chriſts day,</hi> and he that ſees Chriſts day of his <hi>firſt</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, by <hi>faith</hi> can ſee his <hi>ſecond</hi> appearing. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. of all the Saints in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though they inherited not the <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, they ſaw them a far off in the <hi>tenure</hi> of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. God deales with us, as he did with <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:114893:149"/>he would not bring him to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him to the Mount, and <hi>ſhews</hi> it him there; he ſhews it in a <hi>Viſion,</hi> in the Viſion, and glaſſe of the <hi>promiſes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tranſlates us, he ſhews us what Heaven is. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when we come to Heaven, there we ſhall ſee from the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Viſion,</hi> but here we may look from the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Viſion;</hi> that we may know what the conveyance is, whence it comes, the Apoſtle adds this word, <hi>The Crowne of life, the Crowne promiſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet he tells us not <hi>where</hi> it is promiſed, nor in what <hi>place</hi> of Scripture. The Apoſtles were full of quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet ſometimes they did forbeare them too.

As St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayth well, <hi>love</hi> is onely that that finds no <hi>difficulty,</hi> it <hi>leaps</hi> over every <hi>impediment,</hi> and obſtacle, there is <hi>nothing</hi> can ſtand in the way of <hi>love,</hi> to keep it from Chriſt. Nothing is <hi>hard</hi> to <hi>love,</hi> God cannot give a <hi>Command</hi> ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> to the eye of <hi>fleſh,</hi> and blood, he cannot lay ſo much <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>ſuffering,</hi> but love will <hi>beare</hi> it, it makes <hi>all</hi> things <hi>eaſie.</hi> The Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> he tells us in 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. of keeping the <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi> by <hi>Love;</hi> and then followes, <hi>This is love to keepe his Commandements, and his Commandements are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</hi> Why are they not <hi>grevious? Love</hi> accounts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing <hi>eaſie.</hi> Therefore, becauſe he would ſhew the <hi>way</hi> how we are to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> and to come to the Crown, he ſayth he hath reſerved it, <hi>For them that love him,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>love</hi> will <hi>endure,</hi> and beare <hi>all</hi> things, <hi>love</hi> will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure <hi>any</hi> thing for God. There is good reaſon, and it was very <hi>proper,</hi> that the Apoſtle ſhould place it ſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is not <hi>excluſive,</hi> it doth not <hi>exclude</hi> other graces that are <hi>not</hi> mentioned. The Crowne is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>other</hi> places, to <hi>other</hi> vertues. There is no vertue but hath the promiſe of the Crowne made to it in ſome place.</p>
                  <p>See the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God, he ſo gives ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>one</hi> grace, that he paſſeth not <hi>by</hi> another. As you have it concerning the Saints in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, there is an <hi>honour</hi> done to <hi>every</hi> Saint, ſometimes to <hi>one,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>another.</hi> Sometimes <hi>Job</hi> is memorable for <hi>patience,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>faith, David</hi> for <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> There is <hi>no</hi> Saint of God in Scripture, but hath
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:114893:153"/>ſome remarkable note of <hi>commendation;</hi> God ſo <hi>honours one,</hi> that he doth not <hi>forget</hi> the <hi>reſt,</hi> every one in his way and kind. So it is with <hi>graces,</hi> they are all <hi>amiable,</hi> and lovely, and have commendation from Heaven, but not all at the <hi>ſame time.</hi> Every one interreſſeth in the Crowne, but ſometime <hi>one</hi> hath the promiſe, ſometimes <hi>another,</hi> to encourage us to all. That we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to patience, there is the promiſe to <hi>that,</hi> that we may be ſtirred up to <hi>purity,</hi> it is promiſed to <hi>that.</hi> Againe, to <hi>faith,</hi> the promiſe is made to <hi>that,</hi> and ſo of the reſt, every grace hath the promiſe: therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in <hi>other</hi> places the promiſe is made to <hi>feare,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>purity,</hi> the Apoſtle here ſingles out the <hi>Miſtris</hi> grace, and ſettles the promiſe on her, on <hi>love,</hi> they are not excluded though they be not named.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is not a <hi>ſtrait, narrow</hi> expreſſion, but very <hi>full,</hi> ſo full that it <hi>comprehends</hi> all other expreſſions. Tell me what grace you would have, cannot I find it in <hi>love?</hi> Becauſe <hi>love is the Bond of perfection;</hi> in that it is made to <hi>love,</hi> it is made to <hi>all;</hi> there is <hi>none</hi> wanting, where <hi>love</hi> is, <hi>Love is the fullfilling of the Law,</hi> it is <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> in that it is all the Commandements, it is all <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> all duties are in <hi>love;</hi> in that it is <hi>all duties,</hi> it is <hi>all graces;</hi> if <hi>love</hi> be named, all is named. As there is <hi>no</hi> grace that is in <hi>graine,</hi> that hath the <hi>true</hi> ſtamp, if <hi>love</hi> be wanting, and there is no grace that ſhall ever carry the <hi>Crowne,</hi> where <hi>love</hi> is not. St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it cleare, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Knowledge, faith, Almſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That you may ſee the reaſon of it, the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. when he quotes that place out of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 46. he varies the word, being guided by the Spirit of God: the word in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is, <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore that we may ſee it is <hi>large,</hi> the <hi>number</hi> is varied, there is an alteration of the <hi>number,</hi> as well as of the <hi>grace.</hi> He begins the Propoſition in the <hi>Singular</hi> number, <hi>Bleſſed is the man.</hi> See the wiſdome of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, it ſhould according to the tenure of the ſame number, run thus, <hi>He ſhall receive the Crowne of life which God hath promiſed to him that loves him.</hi> No, he varies the <hi>number,</hi> and ſayth, <hi>That God hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> Leaſt any that are not called to <hi>ſuffering</hi> ſhould doubt of the <hi>Crowne,</hi> they are <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and ſhall receive the <hi>Crowne</hi> of life that <hi>ſuffer,</hi> but God hath not called <hi>me</hi> to <hi>afflictions;</hi> he ſets a gap open of comfort for them here, it is for <hi>them,</hi> and for <hi>all</hi> that <hi>love</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>It is ordinary in Scripture to <hi>enlarge</hi> the <hi>promiſe,</hi> Chriſt inlargeth the <hi>precept, That which I ſay to one, I ſay to all, watch.</hi> As he there inlargeth the <hi>precept,</hi> ſo in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place he inlargeth the <hi>promiſe, I pray not for theſe alone, but for all that ſhall beleive in my name to the end of the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:114893:154"/>World.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> follows it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>The Crowne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day.</hi> I, <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall have it, but <hi>none</hi> elſe? Yes, <hi>not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me, but to all that love him.</hi> So St. <hi>James</hi> here varies in a heavenly ſtraine, he pronounceth, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth tribulation, for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crowne of life.</hi> I, <hi>he</hi> ſhall, but <hi>none</hi> elſe? yes, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he, but it is promiſed to <hi>all that love him.</hi> It is no ſtrait expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>To draw all to a head, you ſee the <hi>ſum</hi> of it is thus much. It ſets downe the <hi>qualification</hi> of the <hi>perſon</hi> that ſhall be capable of the <hi>Crowne</hi> of glory, here is the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he muſt be one that <hi>loves</hi> God. It ſets downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the <hi>qualification</hi> of that <hi>perſon</hi> that will <hi>ſtoutly,</hi> and valiantly <hi>endure</hi> tribulations, he muſt get abundance of the <hi>love</hi> of God in his heart. If we <hi>ſuffer not,</hi> if God lay it on us, we ſhall never <hi>reigne,</hi> and if we <hi>love</hi> not, we will never <hi>ſuffer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no <hi>promiſe</hi> of God, but hath a <hi>qualification</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with it. It is a great errour among us, we are ready to catch at the <hi>promiſe,</hi> but never to take notice of the <hi>qualification.</hi> There is never a promiſe made, but the perſon muſt be <hi>ſo</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi> qualified, there is a <hi>condition</hi> goes along with the <hi>promiſe.</hi> The <hi>condition</hi> is the <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> As if it be the promiſe of <hi>forgiveneſſe,</hi> the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the perſon is, it is to thoſe that are <hi>penitent,</hi> that repent, God never gave <hi>forgiveneſſe,</hi> where there was not the work of <hi>repentance.</hi> If it be the promiſe of <hi>Salvation,</hi> there is the qualification of the perſon, he muſt be a <hi>Beleiver,</hi> faith comes in: God never gives <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> where he doth not firſt work <hi>faith,</hi> to lay hold of it. If it be the promiſe of <hi>glory,</hi> there is a qualification too, <hi>perſeverance, To thoſe that continue in well doing, there ſhall be glory, and honour, and immortality;</hi> there ſhall be <hi>eternall life</hi> to them.</p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:114893:155"/>
                  <p>God never gave the <hi>Crowne</hi> of glory, nor never will, but where he gives the grace of <hi>perſeverance</hi> to hold out, here is the qualification. If it be this <hi>Crowne</hi> that is here ſpoken of; here is the qualification, thoſe that <hi>ſuffer</hi> tentation, there is <hi>one;</hi> thoſe that <hi>love</hi> God, there is the <hi>great</hi> qualification.</p>
                  <p>If therefore we look to have a true infallible intereſt in the <hi>promiſe,</hi> let us look to get the propriety of the <hi>qualification.</hi> If we be not perſons <hi>qualified,</hi> we have no intereſt in the <hi>promiſe.</hi> Many men goe on in ſin, and ſtill <hi>flatter</hi> themſelves with hope in the <hi>promiſe, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> men talke of forgiveneſſe as familiarly as if it were written by the hand of God. <hi>Impenitent</hi> men that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not ſin, talk of <hi>glory,</hi> and Heaven, and of inheriting the <hi>Crowne,</hi> and hope for that; it is a <hi>poore</hi> hope, there is no <hi>qualification,</hi> God never gave them a promiſe. There can be no hope of <hi>Heaven,</hi> where there is not a <hi>promiſe;</hi> there can be no <hi>intereſt</hi> where there is not a <hi>promiſe;</hi> God never gave a promiſe of <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> to the <hi>impenitent,</hi> to men that <hi>goe on</hi> in ſin, but that <hi>forſake</hi> them; he never <hi>promiſed</hi> Heaven to the <hi>preſumptuous</hi> man, but to him that layes hold of it by <hi>faith.</hi> If we will have intereſt in the <hi>promiſe,</hi> we muſt get the <hi>qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, where there is this <hi>condition,</hi> and <hi>qualification,</hi> though our <hi>names</hi> be not written upon the <hi>promiſe,</hi> yet the names of all that are ſo <hi>qualified,</hi> are as good as written. There is no <hi>promiſe,</hi> but hath the <hi>names</hi> of all the perſons that are ſo <hi>qualified,</hi> graven on it, not <hi>expreſly,</hi> but <hi>virtually.</hi> If the promiſe be made to <hi>faith,</hi> every <hi>beleiver</hi> is in that promiſe. If it be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>repentance,</hi> every <hi>penitents</hi> name is written there, as if it were ſet there, he hath an <hi>intereſt:</hi> where there is a <hi>qualification,</hi> there cannot be a miſſing of the <hi>promiſe.</hi>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:114893:155"/>Look for the qualification, and for <hi>this</hi> qualification of <hi>love, Thoſe that love God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, there are no <hi>limits,</hi> or <hi>bounds</hi> ſet downe, that is our great <hi>comfort;</hi> it is not ſaid thoſe that <hi>love</hi> God <hi>much,</hi> nor thoſe that <hi>love</hi> God <hi>moſt,</hi> but ſimply to <hi>thoſe that love him,</hi> to let us ſee, that as <hi>much</hi> love ſhall have a <hi>great</hi> reward, ſo <hi>any</hi> love if it be but little, ſhall have <hi>ſome;</hi> God will not <hi>quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> if it be but a <hi>ſpark</hi> of love, he will <hi>cherriſh</hi> that. If it be <hi>leſſe</hi> then a ſpark, a <hi>ſmoake</hi> of love, he will cherriſh that. Yet la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get <hi>abundance,</hi> it muſt not be a <hi>weak</hi> remiſſe <hi>love</hi> that is beſtowed on <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>object</hi> is <hi>infinite,</hi> the act muſt anſwer the object. We muſt make our love, we cannot make it <hi>infinite,</hi> we muſt <hi>extend</hi> it as <hi>neare</hi> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, as we can come. It muſt not be <hi>Amor remiſſus,</hi> or <hi>Intermiſſus,</hi> but <hi>perfectus,</hi> and <hi>aſſiduus. True</hi> love obſerve; no <hi>meane,</hi> it keeps no <hi>meaſure;</hi> no <hi>bounds</hi> can be ſet to <hi>true</hi> love, the love of God will <hi>enlarge,</hi> and break out <hi>more</hi> and more. We ſhould love him <hi>wholly,</hi> and <hi>ſolely,</hi> we ſhould love him ſo, as to love nothing <hi>beſides,</hi> we ſhould love him ſo, as to love all things <hi>in</hi> him, and <hi>for</hi> him, and without him <hi>nothing.</hi> We ſhould <hi>love him with all our heart, and ſoul, and mind, and ſtrength;</hi> there are foure things; that is, to love him with <hi>every</hi> faculty, and with the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of every faculty. If I had foure ſouls (as ſome Philoſophers dreamed that we had 3.) all thoſe <hi>foure</hi> were too little; were a man <hi>all ſoul,</hi> all <hi>love,</hi> all that were too <hi>little</hi> to be beſtowed on God. It is a <hi>high</hi> reach, it is true indeed, but we need not <hi>deſpaire,</hi> though it be a <hi>high</hi> reach, it is <hi>attainable</hi> by <hi>us,</hi> becauſe it hath beene attained by <hi>others.</hi> The Saints before, are <hi>magnified</hi> in Scripture, for their <hi>love</hi> of God. We have the ſame <hi>meanes,</hi> the ſame <hi>helps,</hi> and <hi>motives,</hi> and the ſame <hi>encouragements.</hi> If love be wanting (as it is
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:114893:156"/>very much in the World) the reaſon is, becauſe men doe not labour to <hi>thrive,</hi> and <hi>grow</hi> in the <hi>love</hi> of God. God deprives us of the <hi>comfort</hi> of the love of <hi>himſelfe,</hi> becauſe we have no more <hi>love</hi> one to <hi>another.</hi> But yet if we will apply our ſelves to the meanes, love is <hi>recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> it is not all <hi>dead,</hi> nor all the <hi>ſparks</hi> of love, it may be blowne to a <hi>greater</hi> flame. The meanes are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>way</hi> whereby we may profite in the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is this, to <hi>empty</hi> our hearts of all <hi>carnall</hi> love, whither it be the love of the <hi>World,</hi> or of <hi>our</hi> ſelves. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſtands more betweene the love of God, and the heart, then <hi>carnall, Worldly</hi> love, and above all, this <hi>doting</hi> love of our <hi>ſelves.</hi> Every man is for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> we <hi>all ſeeke our ſelves, and not the things that are Chriſts,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle, and we all <hi>love</hi> our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and not the things that belong to <hi>God,</hi> it is very rare to be found, the love of <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>ſincerity.</hi> The reaſon is, the love of our <hi>ſelves,</hi> is ſo <hi>ingrafted,</hi> and Printed in our hearts, that it cannot be gotten out. As he that will take his hand full of <hi>Corne,</hi> muſt firſt <hi>empty</hi> his hand, if it be full of <hi>Sand,</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> or <hi>Gravell.</hi> So, if we will <hi>repleniſh</hi> our hearts with the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> there muſt firſt be an <hi>evacuation,</hi> an <hi>emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying,</hi> an expulſing, and <hi>carrying</hi> out of <hi>carnall</hi> love, the love of the <hi>great</hi> World about us, and the love of the <hi>little</hi> World, the love of our <hi>ſelves. If any man be a lover of the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> ſayth St. <hi>John.</hi> The love of the <hi>World,</hi> and the love of <hi>God</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt together. That is the <hi>firſt</hi> ſtep to be taken, to love God, to put the <hi>World</hi> out of our hearts, and to goe out of our <hi>ſelves.</hi> Chriſt therefore gives that <hi>rule, He that will come after me, let him deny himſelve.</hi> He that will <hi>love God</hi> muſt <hi>unlove himſelfe.</hi> We <hi>dote</hi> upon our <hi>ſelves,</hi> we are <hi>all</hi> for our <hi>ſelves, therefore</hi> we are <hi>nothing</hi> for <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p>That is one ſtep, to love God.</p>
                  <p>When we have <hi>emptied</hi> our hearts of all <hi>carnall ſelfe</hi>-love, and <hi>Worldly</hi> love, then there is another meanes, to conſider with our ſelves oft, to call ourſelves to thoſe meditations, what thoſe <hi>motives</hi> are, that make God ſo <hi>amiable;</hi> how much <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe</hi> there is in God. So much <hi>beauty,</hi> that all the <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>creatures,</hi> even of the <hi>Angells,</hi> further then there is ſomthing of <hi>God</hi> in them, is <hi>deformity</hi> to the <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> all the glory of <hi>Heaven,</hi> further then it is a <hi>reflexion</hi> of Gods glory it is <hi>nothing</hi> to Gods beauty.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of God, how <hi>great</hi> it is, and how great to <hi>us,</hi> to <hi>love</hi> us, and to love us when we were <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and in ſo <hi>great</hi> a meaſure to love us, as to give his Son to <hi>die</hi> for us; to love us ſo much as to <hi>prepare a place</hi> for us. If his love <hi>reflect</hi> upon our hearts, it will beget <hi>love</hi> againe; if we come once to think how <hi>much</hi> God loves <hi>us,</hi> how will it reflect <hi>love</hi> back? One reaſon we love him ſo <hi>little</hi> is, we doe not conſider how he hath loved <hi>us,</hi> and how <hi>Beautifull,</hi> and <hi>Amiable</hi> his preſence is.</p>
                  <p>When we have brought our ſelves to theſe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, another ſtep is to be <hi>frequent,</hi> and converſant in the <hi>word</hi> of God, it is the lively <hi>picture</hi> of the <hi>love</hi> of God. There are <hi>veines,</hi> and paſſages of <hi>Gods</hi> love, and <hi>incentives</hi> to love him in every part; we ſhall not meet with any peice of Scripture, but it will kindle <hi>ſome</hi> part of <hi>love</hi> to God. He that would <hi>Print</hi> love, let him Print the <hi>Bible</hi> in his heart; if we converſe with the <hi>word</hi> of God, that gives <hi>documents</hi> everywhere of the <hi>love</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>That is another ſtep.</p>
                  <p>Then the fourth, that is the ſtep, and aſcent of <hi>prayer.</hi>

                  <p>Then, when we have made this ſtep, there is one more, the oft <hi>inquiſition,</hi> that we make into our owne hearts, and <hi>blame</hi> our ſelves that we love him ſo <hi>little.</hi> O when a man is <hi>offended</hi> with himſelfe for any thing that is contrary, it makes him <hi>diligent</hi> to attaine it. A Chriſtian that knowes what belongs to the <hi>love</hi> of God, how doth he <hi>blame,</hi> and <hi>condemne</hi> himſelfe, that he loves God ſo <hi>little?</hi> That he began to love him ſo <hi>late?</hi> How doth he grudg that any thing ſhould carry <hi>any part</hi> of his <hi>heart,</hi> or of his <hi>love</hi> from God? He thinks the love <hi>loſt</hi> that is caſt upon the <hi>Creature,</hi> he thinks himſelfe a <hi>thiefe</hi> that he ſhould ſteale <hi>any</hi> love from God, that we ſhould <hi>rob</hi> God of our <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> we rob him then of <hi>all,</hi> there is <hi>nothing</hi> that God deſires, but our <hi>love,</hi> therefore in this regard it is, that the Apoſtle ſets here the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Thoſe that love him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we take love <hi>ſingle,</hi> then the promiſe is made to <hi>love,</hi> to love <hi>firſt</hi> of all graces, love hath the <hi>firſt</hi> promiſe, it hath <hi>preheminence</hi> in the <hi>graces,</hi> and <hi>preheminence</hi> in the <hi>Crowne,</hi> it hath the <hi>firſt</hi> portion.</p>
                  <p>Then take it as it is <hi>joyned,</hi> and is in concatination with <hi>other</hi> graces, it hath not onely the <hi>chiefe</hi> place in the promiſe, but <hi>all,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>all,</hi> it includes all <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:114893:157"/>&amp; <hi>gifts,</hi> being accepted of God, as all; the Apoſtle ſets it downe, to ſtir us up above all things to take care to have our hearts <hi>fill'd</hi> &amp; repleniſh'd with the <hi>love</hi> of God: the promiſe is made to love, <hi>They ſhall inherite, and receive the Crowne of life, which God hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Pſalme it is penned in the ſame ſtraine that <hi>Solomons</hi> Book of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> is, it is not enlarged by <hi>produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> but by <hi>coaugmentation.</hi> As in that Book, ſo in this Pſalme, there are many paſſages (even all) that are very precious but they have no <hi>great</hi> dependance one part on another. There is in this Pſalm as many ſeverall <hi>ejaculations,</hi> as there are Sentences there, but yet there is no good documentall <hi>dependance</hi> between them.</p>
                  <p>The paſſages of this Pſalme are rather the <hi>ebolitions</hi> of a devout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oul, then any continued <hi>narration:</hi> A kind of dependance there is, but it is like that that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the links of thoſe Rings that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of, that were touched with a Load-ſtone. The parts they
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:114893:160"/>doe hang one upon another, not by rules of <hi>Art,</hi> but by the touch of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And yet that is ſet forth with that variety, that a man that reads the Pſalme will think that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> was in <hi>all</hi> the ſeverall kinds, and ſorts of Divine tempers. In ſome paſſages you have him tranſported with the rapture of <hi>admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> in another breaking forth into humble devout <hi>ſupplication;</hi> then againe, into penitentiall <hi>confeſſion;</hi> then into holy purpoſes and <hi>reſolutions;</hi> and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, making of ſerious, and ſolemn <hi>proteſtations</hi> to walk in the Commandements of God; and to this head we are to refer this Verſe that now I have read to you.</p>
                  <p>It is a holy <hi>proteſtation</hi> that the Pſalmiſt makes, by way of <hi>Remonſtrance;</hi> or declaration, to teſtifie the great <hi>eſteeme</hi> that he had of the Commandements of God, and the <hi>comfort</hi> he received by them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I have now made choyſe of it, to follow the Scripture which I laſt handled, as a ſupply of that which was not there expreſt. That Scripture ſhewed to us how a Chriſtian may draw <hi>comfort</hi> to himſelfe in the time of <hi>Tribulation,</hi> from the conſideration of the future <hi>Crowne</hi> of glory, that is referred to the <hi>other</hi> life. And here now we have a Foundation of <hi>comfort</hi> laid downe to us for the <hi>preſent,</hi> to be had, and onely to be had in the <hi>word</hi> of God, in the <hi>teſtimonies</hi> that are divine, which were the <hi>rejoycing</hi> of <hi>Davids</hi> heart, and ſo of all others in the ſame condition.</p>
                  <p>It is ſet forth to us in this excellent example, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him that penned the Pſalme, whoſe heart was more deeply ſtricken with the wound of <hi>love</hi> towards the Commandements of God, then any creature that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver breathed upon the Earth, and better verſed in them. By making inquiry into that that was <hi>his</hi> practiſe, we
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:114893:160"/>ſhall the better learne what ſhould be our <hi>owne.</hi> For that purpoſe I will divide the words onely into theſe two parts

                  <p>The <hi>Profeſſion</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Thy teſtimonies have I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a heritage for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The motive in theſe, <hi>For they are the rejoycing of my heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The profeſſion is one of thoſe <hi>many,</hi> that he makes in this Pſalme, but more compleat, and full then <hi>any,</hi> if not then <hi>all</hi> of the reſt. He ſayth in other places of the Pſalme, of Gods Commandements, that he had them in <hi>eſteeme</hi> above <hi>gold,</hi> above <hi>fine Gold, above all riches;</hi> he comes more neare home to the point in this teſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, and it is more full, when he ſayth he eſteemed them as his <hi>Heritage,</hi> as his <hi>lot,</hi> and <hi>portion,</hi> he makes them both, as <hi>Lands,</hi> as <hi>goods,</hi> as <hi>all;</hi> above all temporall things whatſoever. That we may ſee it now more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let us,</p>
                  <p>Firſt conſider what it is, that the Pſalmiſt here ſpeaks of.</p>
                  <p>Then what it is that he <hi>teſtifies</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The thing here ſpoken of, is the word of God, couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under that name. <hi>The teſtimonies of the Lord. Thy teſtimonies.</hi> It is a <hi>relative</hi> name given to the word of God, as indeed moſt of the names whereby it is called in Scripture (if not all) are relative.</p>

                  <p>In regard of <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, the word is called <hi>Voluntas domini,</hi> the <hi>will</hi> of the Lord, becauſe it containes in it
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:114893:161"/>the <hi>declaration</hi> of his will and pleaſure to be wrought by us. It is called, <hi>Verbum domini,</hi> the <hi>word</hi> of the Lord, becauſe it was <hi>publiſhed</hi> by himſelfe, <hi>Viva voce,</hi> at the firſt, when he gave the Commandements, and <hi>voce ſpiritus,</hi> by the ſecret voyce of the <hi>Spirit</hi> after, when he inſpired the Prophets, and Apoſtles to pen it. Then it is called, <hi>Statuta Domini,</hi> the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath <hi>ſtabliſhed,</hi> and ratified it to be the rule of truth, and life, and Salvation for ever.</p>
                  <p>Then in regard of man, it is called <hi>Lex Domini,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of the Lord, <hi>Quia ligat,</hi> it <hi>binds</hi> him to performe, and to obey, and <hi>Timor Domini,</hi> the <hi>feare</hi> of the Lord, becauſe it begets in every one that is acquainted with it, a holy raviſhing, and <hi>feare,</hi> both of the <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>judgements</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>Then in regard of both, it is ſometimes called <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data domini,</hi> the <hi>Commands</hi> of the Lord to be performed by us, and <hi>Judicia domini,</hi> becauſe it containes the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the Lord, to be executed upon us, if we breake it. And <hi>Teſtimonia Domini,</hi> the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the Lord. The <hi>Teſtification,</hi> (as one ſayth) between God and his people; both that they <hi>receive</hi> this Law, and engage themſelves to <hi>obedience,</hi> and conformity to it. So now this linck of words and names hath brought us to the name <hi>here</hi> uſed. A name more frequent then <hi>many</hi> of the reſt, and more <hi>often</hi> uſed, when the Speech is, not onely of the <hi>word</hi> of God it ſelfe, but of any thing that hath reference to it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>Tables</hi> of the Law, that containe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, they have this word on them, they are called <hi>the Tables of teſtimony.</hi> Then the <hi>Ark</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe Tables, that hath this word, it is called, <hi>the Ark of the teſtimony.</hi> Then the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> that held the Ark, had this word ſtamped on it, it is called, <hi>The Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle

                  <p>Yes, there is good reaſon to be given of it, were there no more but this, that we conſider the ineſtimable <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> and Heavenly <hi>treaſure</hi> that is to be found in the <hi>word</hi> of God; it is a rich <hi>Myne</hi> of all celeſtiall <hi>treaſure,</hi> it is a <hi>Store-houſe</hi> of all good things, of all ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

                  <p>Yet there is a better reaſon then this, for if it be ſo that <hi>Heaven</hi> is our inheritance, then the <hi>word</hi> of God is, becauſe it is the word that <hi>poynts</hi> out Heaven, that gives the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of Heaven: We have in the word of God all the <hi>evidences</hi> of Heaven. Whatſoever <hi>title</hi> any Saint hath to Heaven, he hath it in, and out of the <hi>word</hi> of God. There are the <hi>evidences</hi> in the word of God. Both the evidence of <hi>diſcovery,</hi> it is a holy <hi>terrior</hi> of the celeſtiall <hi>Canaan.</hi> And the evidence of <hi>aſſurance,</hi> it is as a ſacred <hi>Deed,</hi> or <hi>Indenture,</hi> betweene God and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaid wittily, when he called it Gods <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</hi> that he ſent to man, for the <hi>declaration</hi> of his will, and <hi>pleaſure;</hi> he might as well have called it, it is Gods <hi>pactionary</hi> Record, or <hi>Deed,</hi> whereby he makes over, and conveyes to us all thoſe <hi>hopes</hi> that we look for in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

                  <p>Now put this together, look as in <hi>humane</hi> affaires, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,</hi> though they be not <hi>properly</hi> the inheritance it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> yet they are called the inheritance, and are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, though not <hi>actually,</hi> yet <hi>virtually,</hi> becauſe all
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:114893:164"/>the <hi>title</hi> we have to an <hi>inheritance,</hi> is in the <hi>Deeds,</hi> and <hi>Evidences;</hi> therefore <hi>evidences</hi> are <hi>precious</hi> things, though it be but a piece of <hi>paper,</hi> or <hi>parchment</hi> full of duſt, and worme-eaten, yet it is as much worth ſometimes, as a <hi>Countrey,</hi> as much worth, as all a mans <hi>poſſeſſions</hi> beſides. So likewiſe it is with the Book of the Scriptures, they are not <hi>actually,</hi> and properly the <hi>inheritance</hi> it ſelfe, they are <hi>Via,</hi> the way to the Kingdome, it is called <hi>The Goſpell of the Kingdome,</hi> nay more, the <hi>Kingdome</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>The Kingdome of God is come among you,</hi> or <hi>to you.</hi> Why the <hi>Kingdome?</hi> Why the <hi>Inheritance?</hi> By the ſame reaſon, both, becauſe here we have the <hi>conveyance,</hi> here we have the <hi>Deed,</hi> here we have the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of whatſoever <hi>title,</hi> or claime we make to <hi>Heaven.</hi> So, here is the reaſon of the appellation, why the Pſalmiſt gives them this word, he makes them his <hi>inheritance,</hi> both becauſe they <hi>point</hi> out the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> we had never had a <hi>portion</hi> in Heaven, but by the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> they convert the <hi>ſoul,</hi> we had never <hi>knowne</hi> of ſuch an inheritance in Heaven, but by the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>

And if we get it, we are not ſo choyſe to part with it, as men are of <hi>temporalls. Naboth</hi> thought it <hi>unlawfull</hi> to part with his <hi>inheritance,</hi> though it were to a <hi>King, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I ſhould ſell the inheritance of my Fathers.</hi> There is no Chriſtian, but if he underſtand himſelfe aright, in the way of Heaven, will be of <hi>Naboths</hi> reſolution, and <hi>Naboths</hi> temper, he will never reſt till he have gotten

That he may truly value <hi>Heaven,</hi> he will ſet a valuation upon the <hi>word</hi> of God, and work himſelfe to <hi>Davids</hi> temper; here is his profeſſion of himſelfe. <hi>Thy teſtimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever.</hi> That is the firſt generall part, <hi>Davids</hi> profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The next is, <hi>Davids Motive;</hi> therefore I call it his <hi>Motive,</hi> becauſe it <hi>induced</hi> him to be of this Opinion, becauſe,
<q>They are the joy, and rejoycing of my heart.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing will induce a man ſooner to have a good Opinion of any thing, then to have <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> by it; we value, and prize every thing that affords <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;</hi> if it afford true <hi>joy,</hi> it affords <hi>all.</hi> For <hi>joy</hi> is the <hi>flower</hi> that ſprings from every <hi>good,</hi> and is as the <hi>Crowne,</hi> and contentation of all, therefore it was his motive. It runs thus, if we take it in due order. <hi>Thy teſtimonies have beene the rejoycing of my heart, therefore I have taken them as an heritage for ever.</hi> It was <hi>Davids</hi> motive, and it was a good motive. However <hi>worldly</hi> men think it is but a <hi>ſoure,</hi> diſtaſtfull work to be alway Poreing in the <hi>word</hi> of God, they think Chriſtians are but <hi>Melancholly</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the continuall excerciſe and ſtudy of the Scriptures, to be but a <hi>drie,</hi> and diſtaſtfull work; yet the <hi>Saints</hi> of God that have <hi>comfort</hi> from it, they know how precious that excerciſe is, how much <hi>joy</hi> it brings, that the life of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is a life of joy, and that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing is to be picked out of the <hi>word</hi> of God; and that will appeare to us by three Propoſitions that are here contained.</p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:114893:167"/>
                  <p>The firſt is this, that a Chriſtian in <hi>this</hi> world hath his <hi>rejoycing;</hi> he hath his rejoycing <hi>here,</hi> his life, even while it is a life of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> is a life of <hi>rejoycing.</hi> Though they be creatures of <hi>mortification,</hi> though they be Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily excerciſed in <hi>repentance,</hi> though they be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tried by <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>tribulations,</hi> yet Chriſtianity is ſuch an excellent eſtate, that in the middeſt of <hi>tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> they find <hi>comfort;</hi> in the middeſt of <hi>mortification</hi> it adminiſters <hi>rejoycing.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> found it, not onely in <hi>tribulation,</hi> but in other failings, therefore he ſayth of all, <hi>godly ſorrow cauſeth rejoycing.</hi> It muſt needs be, that there muſt be <hi>rejoycing</hi> in godly <hi>ſorrow,</hi> for godly ſorrow <hi>produceth,</hi> and raiſeth <hi>joy:</hi> therefore he ſets it downe in another place. <hi>As ſorrowing, but yet alway rejoycing.</hi> He ſets it downe with advantage; he gives ſorrow, but a <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ut,</hi> as ſorrowing. As if the <hi>ſorrow</hi> of a Chriſtian in the world, were not worthy the name of ſorrow. It is <hi>Sicut,</hi> but <hi>Vera gaudenti,</hi> alway rejoycing, <hi>True</hi> rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſlander, and an evill report that men bring on <hi>Piety,</hi> to think it makes men <hi>ſullen,</hi> and <hi>diſcontented,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in an <hi>afflicted</hi> eſtate. There is nothing makes the heart more <hi>chearfull,</hi> then a good <hi>Conſcience,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing brings a <hi>good</hi> conſcience ſo much, as the <hi>favour</hi> of God, a <hi>conſtant</hi> walking in the wayes of Gods <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> a keeping to the <hi>rules,</hi> and wayes of piety. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is not ſo <hi>ſtoicall</hi> as to <hi>grudge</hi> us of our <hi>joy.</hi> A Chriſtian is ſo far from being <hi>deprived</hi> of <hi>joy,</hi> that he is the onely Creature indeed, that hath the <hi>true</hi> title to it. It doth not take away this affection, it takes away none, it improves none more then this, <hi>Non lollit,</hi> &amp;c. It doth not <hi>take</hi> it away, but rightly <hi>tempers</hi> it, it teacheth us to place it on the <hi>right</hi> object, to keep the <hi>due</hi> bounds, the right <hi>compaſſe.</hi> That we may ſee that it doth not <hi>ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:114893:167"/>or exclude the comfort, or <hi>joy</hi> of the heart, the Scripture calls upon them moſt of all, and gives them <hi>Commands,</hi> and in junctions of <hi>rejoycing;</hi> and it doth it by reduplication, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, O yee righteous,</hi> and leaſt they ſhould not be ready to take the firſt admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Againe I ſay rejoyce,</hi> there is an <hi>injunction</hi> from that. St. <hi>Austin</hi> obſerves well, the Saints in the World are tied to <hi>rejoyce,</hi> to rejoyce in the Lord, <hi>Si non,</hi> &amp;c. If we doe not make uſe of this affection to Gods glory, and our owne comfort, we ſhould repugne the <hi>Command</hi> of God, and more then a <hi>ſingle</hi> Command too, there is a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplication.</hi> And St. <hi>Baſile</hi> obſerves from that that the word is doubled, <hi>Rejoyce, and againe rejoyce,</hi> it notes the <hi>encreaſe,</hi> and augmentation of their <hi>joy;</hi> they ſhould not onely rejoyce a <hi>little,</hi> but <hi>much,</hi> not <hi>once,</hi> but <hi>oft,</hi> they ſhould make it a continuall work.</p>
                  <p>There is good reaſon to ſtir us up to <hi>joy;</hi> all the <hi>bliſſe</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> is ſet downe by <hi>joy, Enter into thy Maſters joy.</hi> And not onely <hi>glory,</hi> but the <hi>firſt</hi> fruits in this World are called by that name, the <hi>joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> To this purpoſe, God encourageth us to it, by the <hi>beſt</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the example of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and if that be too little, by the example of <hi>Angells,</hi> and if that be too little, by the <hi>example</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himſelfe. <hi>There is joy in Heaven, joy among the Angells of God;</hi> when it is ſaid that there is joy in <hi>Heaven</hi> for one ſinner that is converted, there is joy with <hi>God. Joy,</hi> it is the affection that God honoureth, becauſe he will be ſure to <hi>Invite</hi> us to take our <hi>fill</hi> of joy, if it be right, and <hi>ſpirituall</hi> joy. There are none of all the Saints (if we look to them) but they had their time of <hi>rejoycing,</hi> even thoſe that were moſt depreſſed, and <hi>afflicted.</hi> Holy <hi>David, Abraham, Job, Paul,</hi> all theſe had their <hi>times</hi> of <hi>rejoycing. Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> it is a ſtate of <hi>rejoycing,</hi> and the Saints of God have
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:114893:168"/>their times to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in <hi>this</hi> world. That is the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is <hi>another</hi> that ariſeth from this, as they have a <hi>true title</hi> to joy, ſo they have the onely title to <hi>true</hi> joy; it is not <hi>ſuperficiall</hi> joy that they are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with, it is <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi> joy; ſubſtantiall joy is that that is upon <hi>true</hi> grounds, and when joy is <hi>rightly</hi> ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The right <hi>Seat,</hi> where is it? The <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> of a man. It is <hi>joy of heart,</hi> they are the <hi>rejoycing of my heart.</hi> Otherwiſe joy is not <hi>ſubſtantiall,</hi> if it be out of its place, from the Teeth <hi>outward,</hi> in the outward man; it is not <hi>true</hi> joy, unleſſe it be <hi>inward.</hi> If it be <hi>outward</hi> onely, it may be <hi>mirth,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, yet not true <hi>joy,</hi> joy is that that is in the <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>ſprings</hi> from the <hi>heart.</hi> Even <hi>carnall</hi> men will be full of mirth, they will have all the <hi>expreſſions</hi> of joy that are poſſible in the <hi>outward</hi> thing, but it is onely ſuperficiall, <hi>diſſembled</hi> joy, it is not that joy that is truly <hi>within.</hi> For <hi>in the middeſt of that mirth, the heart is ſorry. The joy of the Hypocrite is ſhort, for a moment,</hi> as holy <hi>Job</hi> ſayth. It is as the <hi>crackling of Thornes.</hi> In the middeſt of that mirth there is the <hi>Worme</hi> of Conſcience, that damps all; that is as the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the Wall to <hi>Bellſhazzar,</hi> when it came to be read, it filled him full of <hi>horrour,</hi> and anguiſh, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort, and vexation; there are none of theſe <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> things that can breed <hi>cordiall</hi> ſubſtantiall joy.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, a godly man in the middeſt of <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> can preſerve <hi>joy</hi> of <hi>heart.</hi> It is true, a <hi>godly</hi> man is not alway as the <hi>wicked,</hi> Jocund, and <hi>joviall,</hi> they are not <hi>loud</hi> in their mirth, it may be, they <hi>laugh</hi> not much, but a godly man is ſtill <hi>joyfull,</hi> when he <hi>laughs</hi> not; for there is the true mirth, and joy, that is within. As the Poet ſayd of the running of <hi>Nilus,</hi> the running of <hi>Nilus</hi> is very <hi>ſtill,</hi> yet it is very <hi>ſwift,</hi> though it make not any <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:114893:168"/>of motion; the excellency, ſayth he, of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is in this, that it ſeems <hi>little</hi> to move, and yet it moves <hi>apace.</hi> So it is with the joy of a <hi>godly</hi> man, the joy of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> moves not <hi>outwardly,</hi> there is no <hi>revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> he doth not make <hi>boaſt</hi> of his joy, but then within he hath it; he hath the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of a good <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and there is the <hi>voyce of the Bridegroome, and of the Bride.</hi> The voyce of the <hi>Bridegroome</hi> muſt needs be there, when the voyce of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is there, when the voyce of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is there. There is the <hi>pipeing,</hi> and <hi>dancing,</hi> in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ſence, and all thoſe <hi>concommitants</hi> of <hi>mirth</hi> that attend the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of a <hi>good</hi> conſcience. A godly man onely hath <hi>true</hi> joy, he onely hath <hi>cauſe</hi> to be ſo, therefore <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou haſt put more gladneſſe in my heart, then when their Corne, and Wine, and Oyle increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. God</hi> puts <hi>gladneſſe</hi> in the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>world</hi> puts <hi>glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> in a mans <hi>lips,</hi> and <hi>countenance;</hi> God ſtabliſheth the <hi>heart,</hi> where it ſhall be <hi>durable,</hi> where it is <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi> joy. In that it is ſayd to be in the <hi>heart,</hi> he expreſſeth it to the <hi>full,</hi> it is enough to have joy <hi>there.</hi> That is the ſecond Propoſition; the joy of a Chriſtian is <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantiall,</hi> and <hi>right</hi> ſeated joy. <hi>They are the rojoycing of my heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a third Propoſition from both theſe. This <hi>true</hi> ſubſtantiall joy it doth not ſpring from any other head, it comes not any other way, then by the <hi>word</hi> of God, there we muſt find it. We ſhall never find joy in <hi>Heaven,</hi> unleſſe we firſt find it in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> here joy begins the <hi>glorious</hi> joy. The <hi>grace</hi> of God, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayth, being <hi>begun</hi> here, muſt be <hi>perfected</hi> after; it cannot be <hi>perfected</hi> unleſſe there be <hi>preparations,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings; theſe <hi>preparations</hi> are thoſe that are wrought by the <hi>Word</hi> of God, and here they are conteined. In <hi>worldly</hi> things we cannot find theſe, and a Chriſtian man
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:114893:169"/>doth not make <hi>temporall</hi> things his <hi>joy. Rejoyce not in this, that the Spirits are ſubject to you.</hi> That is, rejoyce not in <hi>Miraculous</hi> gifts, <hi>But rather rejoyce that your names are written in Heaven,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Life;</hi> and if it be <hi>there,</hi> it is written upon the <hi>promiſes,</hi> it is written in the Book of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as <hi>Hilarie</hi> ſpeaks well. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knowes not what belongs to <hi>other</hi> joy, to <hi>ſecular</hi> joy, he cannot fetch his joy from any other <hi>Fountaine,</hi> or Spring, but from <hi>hence.</hi> If at any time he rejoyce in <hi>temporall</hi> things, it is in a <hi>ſubordinate</hi> reference to <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he rejoyce in <hi>them,</hi> it is but when he <hi>forgets</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it may be, ſometimes they may <hi>affect</hi> his heart, but in the end, <hi>temporal</hi> things leave us in the lurch, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>continue</hi> that joy to us; we cannot carry that joy of the <hi>World</hi> to <hi>Heaven.</hi> A godly man ſhould be ſo far from <hi>rejoycing</hi> in, that he is to be <hi>mortified</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> he <hi>Sacrifices</hi> himſelfe to the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of it, doe you think he wil take a pride to <hi>delight</hi> in it? no, the joy that he ſucks to himſelf, he draws from the <hi>promiſes</hi> of ſalvation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in <hi>theſe</hi> teſtifications, theſe <hi>teſtimonies</hi> of the Lord he drawes them from the Scriptures. So here, the word of God onely affords <hi>true</hi> joy; ſo it doth in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and conſiderations of it. If it be the word preached, it affords joy, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. it is ſaid of thoſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, There was a great deale of joy in that Citty,</hi> becauſe of the Preaching of the word. If it be the word <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, It is the joy of the righteous to doe good,</hi> as wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks; if it be the <hi>revolving</hi> of it by <hi>meditation,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of it begets <hi>joy.</hi> The word of God, as it mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies <hi>notions,</hi> ſo it multiplies <hi>rejoycing,</hi> ſo here is the way to <hi>true</hi> comfort, and joy: if any goe about to find it in the <hi>World,</hi> there is nothing that we can take <hi>delight,</hi> and joy in. If any man would have this Water of <hi>Life,</hi> he muſt with the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> carry his Paile to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:114893:169"/>
                     <hi>Jacobs Well.</hi> Here is the <hi>Balme of Cilead,</hi> for every <hi>Wounded Samaritan,</hi> as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks; the Scriptures have <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and <hi>Medecines</hi> to heale all the Wounds of the Soul; it is ſo profitable, that <hi>David</hi> ſayth, <hi>Except thy Law had beene my Delight, I had periſhed in mine afflictions.</hi> He was in <hi>afflictions,</hi> but he had a <hi>Cordiall,</hi> he made Gods <hi>Law</hi> his <hi>delight,</hi> and that kept him from <hi>Sinking,</hi> and from being <hi>Overwhelmed,</hi> with ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>They are the Waters of <hi>comfort,</hi> the <hi>ſtill</hi> Waters of comfort, of which the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks in another place, they are to be found in the <hi>word</hi> of God. Here is the <hi>Treaſurie,</hi> and Store-houſe of all joy, and <hi>comfort;</hi> if we will fetch it from any place, we muſt come hither, and <hi>here</hi> we are ſure to find it.</p>
                  <p>It is true, <hi>joy</hi> of it ſelfe is a <hi>naturall</hi> affection, but <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> joy is not <hi>naturall;</hi> it is not from <hi>nature</hi> to know what belongs to <hi>ſpirituall</hi> joy; it is onely the <hi>Word</hi> of God that can teach us what it is, and what belongs to it. <hi>Seneea</hi> himſelfe had ſome glimps of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every man (ſayth he) thinks it is an <hi>eaſie</hi> thing to be Merry, what more <hi>eaſie?</hi> No, it is a <hi>hard</hi> thing to be <hi>joyfull,</hi> though it be <hi>eaſie</hi> to be <hi>Merry.</hi> Joy is not ſo <hi>wanton</hi> a thing, as the World takes it; joy is a <hi>ſevere</hi> thing, in <hi>true</hi> joy there is <hi>ſeverity,</hi> and gravity, it is an excellent vertue that way. Therefore in his Epiſtle to <hi>Lucelius,</hi> above all, if thou wouldeſt make thy life <hi>happy,</hi> learne how to <hi>joy aright;</hi> it is a Leſſon <hi>hard</hi> to be learned. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> layes it as a <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ground of a <hi>good</hi> life; there is no greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>proficiency,</hi> then this, for a man to <hi>rejoyce</hi> as he ought, and in <hi>what</hi> things he ought. He hath gotten a great maſtery of himſelfe, and a great victory over the World, and is come to a <hi>high</hi> pitch of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and to a
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:114893:170"/>high pitch of the practiſe of <hi>Piety,</hi> that knowes <hi>how,</hi> and in <hi>what</hi> to rejoyce <hi>aright.</hi> If we will learne that, we muſt learne it from the <hi>word</hi> of God; it is our <hi>joy,</hi> and teacheth us to rejoyce <hi>aright,</hi> that is, <hi>not</hi> to rejoyce in the things of the <hi>World,</hi> not to rejoyce in the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of <hi>ſin.</hi> Heare what devout <hi>Proſper</hi> ſayth of them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a great <hi>good</hi> to <hi>rejoyce,</hi> yet to rejoyce <hi>amiſs</hi> in the things of the World, is a great <hi>evill</hi> that <hi>ſeperates</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> from <hi>Heaven.</hi> If not in the things of the <hi>world,</hi> then not in the pleaſures of <hi>ſin,</hi> as now a dayes many take <hi>pleaſure</hi> in nothing but onely in doing <hi>miſchiefe,</hi> whereas <hi>Charity rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth. Piety</hi> rejoyceth not in <hi>ſin,</hi> nor in the World, but what doth ſhee <hi>rejoyce</hi> in? In <hi>God,</hi> and in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the hope of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and in making uſe of the <hi>word</hi> of God. It rejoyceth in this, that <hi>piety</hi> is her <hi>practiſe,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> her <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> her <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> her <hi>Comforter,</hi> and the <hi>word</hi> of God her perpetuall <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</hi>

                  <p>If we will learne to rejoyce in theſe things, we muſt labour to get holy <hi>Davids</hi> temper, <hi>David</hi> was a man as much perplexed with <hi>ſorrow</hi> as any man in the World, he had his <hi>Tribulations,</hi> but as he was a man of ſorrow, ſo at the ſame time he was a man of <hi>rejoycing,</hi> a man of <hi>joy,</hi> and thoſe joyes he ſtill had, out of the meditation of Gods <hi>teſtimonies;</hi> ſo great joy, that in one place he ſaith, <hi>Thy Statutes have been my ſong in the houſe of my Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,</hi> and here he ſayth, they are my <hi>rejoycing,</hi> and the <hi>rejoycing of my heart.

                  <p>Here is a good example propounded to us, for the manifeſtation of it; the Prophet <hi>David</hi> he doth in this Pſalme intermingle <hi>profeſſions</hi> with <hi>reſolutions,</hi> and <hi>reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions</hi> againe with <hi>profeſſions;</hi> ſometimes leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to decay in <hi>practiſe,</hi> he quickens himſelfe by new reſolutions: Sometimes againe, leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to <hi>reſolve</hi> to <hi>no</hi> purpoſe, he makes teſtification of his <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe;</hi> ſo theſe two follow one another through the Pſalme.

                  <p>One advantage is in the Emphaſis, <hi>I have loved thy Commandements,</hi> by Commandements he underſtands the <hi>word</hi> of God, yet it is more powerfull then ſo; it is not, I have loved thy <hi>word;</hi> but I have loved that part of thy word that is thy <hi>Commandements,</hi> the <hi>mandatory</hi> part. There are <hi>ſome</hi> parts of the <hi>will,</hi> &amp; <hi>word</hi> of God, that even <hi>ungodly</hi> men will be content to <hi>love,</hi> there is the <hi>promiſory</hi> part; all men gather and <hi>catch</hi> at the <hi>promiſes,</hi> and ſhew love to theſe. The reaſon is clear, there is <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and <hi>profit,</hi> and <hi>gaine,</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> in the promiſes: but a <hi>pious</hi> ſoul doth not onely looke to the <hi>promiſes,</hi> but to the <hi>Commands,</hi> the <hi>mandatory</hi> part as well as the <hi>promiſſory:</hi> Piety looks on Chriſt as a <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> as well as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and not onely on him as a <hi>Mediatour,</hi> but as a <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> it doth not onely live by <hi>faith,</hi> but it liveth by <hi>rule,</hi> it makes indeed the <hi>promiſes,</hi> the ſtay, and <hi>ſtaffe</hi> of a Chriſtians life, but it makes the <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi> of God the <hi>levell.</hi> A pious heart knowes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>promiſe</hi> there is ſome implicite <hi>command;</hi> in the <hi>qualification,</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of every <hi>promiſe,</hi> there is an <hi>implicite</hi> Command conteyned; it knowes that for the fullfilling of the <hi>promiſes,</hi> they belong to <hi>God,</hi> but the fullfilling of the <hi>Commands</hi> they belong to <hi>us,</hi> therefore it looks ſo, upon the enjoying of that that is <hi>promiſed,</hi> that it firſt will doe that that is <hi>commanded,</hi> there is no hope of attaining comfort in the <hi>promiſe,</hi> but in <hi>keeping</hi> of the <hi>precept,</hi> therefore he pitcheth the Emphaſis, I have loved thy <hi>word,</hi> that is true, and <hi>all</hi> thy word, and this part the <hi>mandatory</hi> part, <hi>I have loved thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> here is <hi>love</hi> to God, to love God when he <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:114893:174"/>that is the firſt advantage.</p>

                  <p>There is no man that is ſet ſo much upon the <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>one,</hi> but it may be he hath ſomething in him, whereby he can incline to <hi>love</hi> ſome <hi>other;</hi> if it touch not his <hi>boſome,</hi> his <hi>darling</hi> ſin. <hi>Herod</hi> himſelfe heard <hi>John in many things gladly;</hi> it is the ordinary practiſe of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> I, and of <hi>Prophane</hi> men too, they <hi>divide</hi> the Tables betweene them, if they <hi>adhere</hi> to the <hi>firſt</hi> Table, as <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> it is with <hi>neglect</hi> of the <hi>ſecond;</hi> if they adhere to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> as <hi>prophane</hi> men, it is with <hi>contempt</hi> of the <hi>firſt:</hi> it is not ſo with true <hi>piety,</hi> piety gives not obedience out of <hi>humour,</hi> but out of <hi>duty,</hi> it doth not obey out of <hi>choyſe,</hi> but it obeys out of <hi>obligation.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And if I ſhould read the words ſo now to you, it would be a faire, and proper Leſſon to <hi>us</hi> to learne, that we are now in the ſtate of <hi>Pilgrims, We have here no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Citty.</hi> As the Patriarchs of old, we ſtill <hi>look</hi> for a Countrey.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:114893:184"/>to this new removing from <hi>Manſion</hi> to <hi>Manſion,</hi> from <hi>Company</hi> to <hi>Company.</hi> But I will not read the words ſo, but take them as they are expreſt in the Text, <hi>From ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi> So, it is a ſhort, but an accurate <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> of the ſpirituall <hi>growth</hi> of a Chriſtian in this world, from <hi>one degree</hi> of righteouſneſſe to <hi>another,</hi> ſo breathing after <hi>perfection,</hi> and it is a part of that excellent Pſalme that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> made, to let us underſtand the great <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>benefit,</hi> and priviledge that comes to us by our frequent repairing to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> One great priviledge is this, that here it is that we get ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>strength.</hi> Here we not onely had our <hi>initiation</hi> to Chriſt, and the firſt ſeeds of Piety ſowne, and the firſt Foundation laid, but we get <hi>growth,</hi> and goe on, and make progreſſe in piety.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>many</hi> excellent paſſages in the Pſalme, yet this is <hi>one</hi> of the moſt <hi>remarkable,</hi> for there is ſomthing in it <hi>more</hi> then in the <hi>whole</hi> Pſalme it ſelfe. The Pſalme it ſelfe is none of thoſe that are called the Pſalmes of <hi>degrees,</hi> yet this is a <hi>Text,</hi> or Verſe of <hi>Degrees.</hi> And thoſe degrees are not ſuch as relate to the <hi>ſteps</hi> of the <hi>materiall</hi> Tabernacle, but ſhew the ſteps of our <hi>aſcention,</hi> the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent that we make up to <hi>Heaven.</hi> There are two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Pſalme that point at it. One in Verſ. 5. <hi>In whoſe heart are thy wayes;</hi> or as ſome read it thy <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions,</hi> the degrees of <hi>proficiency</hi> whereby Chriſtians come to ſtature, or great growth of piety, are Gods <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions,</hi> Gods aſcentions becauſe they lead to him, and <hi>ours</hi> becauſe they carry us up to God.</p>
                  <p>Another place that points to theſe <hi>degrees,</hi> or <hi>aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> is in the Title of the Pſalme: it is one of thoſe Pſalmes that is aſcribed <hi>To him that excelleth,</hi> or to the <hi>End,</hi> ſhewing, that the onely way to <hi>excell,</hi> is to <hi>hold</hi> out to the <hi>end,</hi> and he that holds out to the <hi>end,</hi> of all others
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:114893:184"/>will be the moſt <hi>excellent,</hi> and both theſe are ſtamped, and graved upon this Verſe. One part is to him that <hi>excelleth, They grow from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi> Another part that is to the <hi>End, Till every one appeare before God in Zion.</hi> According to theſe two there are two parts.</p>
                  <p>There is the <hi>motion</hi> of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>reſt,</hi> that is <hi>God,</hi> in the laſt words, <hi>Every one of them appeares before God in Zion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The motion is in the firſt part of the words, and there are three things in that: There is,
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Qualitas motus,</hi> and</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Meta,</hi> and</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Continuatio motus.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The quality of the motion, they goe on, they grow up.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>mark</hi> to which it is directed, to <hi>ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>perpetuation</hi> of the motion, <hi>From degree to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> from <hi>Vertue,</hi> to <hi>vertue, From ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I ſpeake of theſe perticulars, there is one little <hi>particle</hi> in the front of the words, that ſets out to us the condition of the <hi>perſons</hi> (though it be <hi>indeffinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> here expreſt) that makes this goodly progreſſe, this faire and lovely <hi>growth</hi> in piety. The word is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deffinite, <hi>They goe,</hi> or <hi>They grow,</hi> therefore it refers to <hi>two</hi> Verſes before, the fourth, and fifth, there you read who are theſe, <hi>they,</hi> that are here ſpoken of, <hi>Eleſſed is the man in whoſe heart are thy wayes. Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength the Lord is. Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe.</hi> It is <hi>Plurall</hi> in the one, and <hi>Singular</hi> in the other. It is <hi>Singular</hi> in Verſ. 5. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength the Lord is,</hi> and according to that courſe and Expoſition of the word, a man would have thought it ſhould have run thus, <hi>He will grow from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi> But the

                  </p>
                  <p>One is, it is <hi>perſeverance</hi> that <hi>ſublimates all</hi> graces. It is not a <hi>perticular</hi> diſtinct grace of it ſelfe, but that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Thread</hi> that goes through every grace, and carries them to their <hi>pitch,</hi> and <hi>perfection. Perſeverance</hi> is not <hi>faith,</hi> but the <hi>continuance,</hi> and ſtedfaſtneſſe of faith. <hi>Perſeverance</hi> is not <hi>repentance,</hi> but the habituall <hi>perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi> of repentance: The <hi>pitch</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>higheſt</hi> flight of <hi>love,</hi> the <hi>fullneſſe</hi> of <hi>repentance,</hi> the <hi>lengthening</hi> of the line of <hi>patience,</hi> to the greateſt extent and longitude: all theſe are nothing but <hi>perſeverance.</hi> It is not any <hi>one</hi> vertue, but the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>all;</hi> it is the grace <hi>Lawrell,</hi> the <hi>wreath</hi> that carries <hi>every</hi> grace, and <hi>vertue,</hi> to the <hi>height.</hi> That is once excellency.</p>
                  <p>Another excellency is, that it is the grace that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders next upon <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>next</hi> grace to <hi>Heaven</hi> is <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance;</hi> there is but <hi>halfe</hi> a ſtep between <hi>Perſeveranee,</hi>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:114893:186"/>and <hi>glory.</hi> There is no grace that will carry us to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> of it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> without <hi>perſeverance;</hi> not <hi>faith,</hi> if it <hi>faint;</hi> not <hi>love,</hi> if it <hi>decline,</hi> and wax cold, not <hi>obedience,</hi> if it give over; not <hi>repentance,</hi> or <hi>humility,</hi> or <hi>patience,</hi> or <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> if they have not their <hi>perfect</hi> work. <hi>Faith,</hi> that will <hi>hold,</hi> but that it holds out, it is from <hi>perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Love</hi> will take its flight, and <hi>mount</hi> up, but that it mounts up to the higheſt, to <hi>Heaven,</hi> it muſt be from <hi>perſeverance. Obedience</hi> will follow after Chriſt, but to hold to the <hi>end</hi> in obedience, to be carried to the <hi>full</hi> length, it's from <hi>perſeverance.</hi> So <hi>every</hi> grace hath that that is the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of it, from the grace of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Without it, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayth very well, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that <hi>fights</hi> can hope to <hi>overcome</hi> at all; or if he overcome, and conquer a <hi>little,</hi> he cannot look for the <hi>Crowne,</hi> unleſſe he conquer ſtill, and goe <hi>on.</hi> There is the ſecond excellency of perſeverance.</p>
                  <p>The third, and principall excellency of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that that more expreſly toucheth upon the Text, it is the <hi>continuation</hi> of the <hi>motion</hi> of a Chriſtian, that that keeps a man <hi>ſtill</hi> going. And motion is excellent in every Creature; the Creature, the more excellent it is, the more excellent it is in its <hi>motion.</hi> The <hi>Earth,</hi> that is the <hi>loweſt</hi> Element, and the <hi>baſeſt,</hi> moves not at <hi>all.</hi> The <hi>Water</hi> that is next above the Earth, moves, but not ſo faſt as the <hi>Aire</hi> that is above the Water; and the <hi>Aire,</hi> though it move <hi>faſter,</hi> and more conſtantly then the Water, yet it moves not ſo <hi>nobly,</hi> and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo <hi>faſt</hi> as the Heavens, the <hi>celeſtiall</hi> bodies, and the <hi>Star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> of Heaven. Take but one inſtance, the <hi>Moone</hi> hath <hi>two</hi> motions, which ſhee diſpatcheth at <hi>once,</hi> with a great deale of <hi>ſwiftneſſe,</hi> and <hi>conſtancy.</hi> Let <hi>men</hi> that are below <hi>blaſpheme,</hi> and <hi>curſe,</hi> let <hi>Dogs</hi> bark, let the <hi>Winds</hi> blow, let <hi>ſtormes</hi> bluſter, and the <hi>Clouds</hi> frowne,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:114893:187"/>the <hi>Moone</hi> goes on to finiſh her courſe. So a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> if he be of a <hi>heavenly</hi> temper, there will be the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Heavens, perpetuity</hi> of motion: <hi>Perſeverance</hi> makes the motion <hi>perpetuall,</hi> it gives <hi>perennity</hi> to the motion of a Chriſtian, that though a Chriſtian meet with many <hi>diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider it under the ſimilitude of <hi>Vitall</hi> motion, for as I ſaid, their <hi>going</hi> on, is their <hi>growing</hi> on. <hi>Growth</hi> is a <hi>vitall</hi> motion; for properly nothing is ſaid to <hi>grow</hi> but that that hath <hi>life.</hi> Therefore <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> obſerves, there is a great deale of difference betwixt thoſe two words, <hi>augmentation,</hi> and <hi>extention,</hi> things <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate</hi> that want <hi>life,</hi> may receive <hi>extention,</hi> and <hi>dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> but they are not properly ſaid to <hi>grow,</hi> but things that have life, <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>living</hi> Creatures. <hi>Growth</hi> therefore properly is a <hi>vitall</hi> motion, and that <hi>vitall</hi> motion is remarkable in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> in a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſence; there are many words whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>The phraſe, or word of <hi>abounding,</hi> is a metaphor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>Rivers,</hi> Rivers that get encreaſe by <hi>running.</hi> A man would think a River in continuall <hi>motion</hi> ſhould doe nothing but ſpend it ſelfe, and not <hi>get,</hi> but <hi>loſe;</hi> but the <hi>longer</hi> it runs, the more <hi>acceſſe</hi> of water flowes to it, and the <hi>further</hi> its progreſſe, the <hi>greater</hi> it is. It is little at the <hi>head,</hi> but it is great at the <hi>foot,</hi> the longer it goes on. So ſhould a Chriſtian be like <hi>Ezekiells waters,</hi> that at the firſt were but up to the <hi>Ancles,</hi> and then aſcended till they came to the <hi>Neck,</hi> till at laſt they covered the whole man; ſuch is the ſwelling <hi>Spirituall,</hi> the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and <hi>abounding</hi> in grace.</p>

                  <p>The other word, of <hi>growing</hi> is a metaphor taken <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi> from <hi>all ſorts of vitalls.</hi> It is taken ſometimes in Scripture from <hi>building;</hi> as a <hi>building</hi> from a <hi>ſmall</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning growes to a <hi>great</hi> vaſtneſſe, and magnitude; ſo a Chriſtian being <hi>built on the Foundation of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, our bleſſed Lord being the Corner ſtone, he growes up to a holy Temple in the Lord, Epheſ.</hi> 2. Sometimes it is taken from the ſimilitude of <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Trees, Hoſea</hi> 14. <hi>They ſhall grow up as the Lillie, and as the Vine, their Root ſhall be like Lebanon.</hi> Sometimes againe, it is taken from the ſimilitude of other Creatures, in <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. ſpeaking of righteous men, he ſayth, <hi>They ſhall grow as the Calves of the ſtall.</hi> Sometimes it is taken from our <hi>ſelves,</hi> from the ſimilitude of the growth of the <hi>body,</hi> corporall growth. So in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. he ſpeaks of <hi>Growing up to the fullneſſe of ſtature, to a perfect man in Chriſt.</hi> As the <hi>body</hi> firſt hath <hi>ſeed,</hi> and then <hi>life,</hi> and then <hi>ſupply</hi> of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then by it it comes to <hi>height,</hi> and ſtature.

                  <p>That you may underſtand it better, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times calls it a <hi>growing up to ſtrength, Rom.</hi> 15.

Put theſe together, and here is enough to make a <hi>ſpirituall man,</hi> and if there be a ſpirituall <hi>man,</hi> there muſt be <hi>growth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in the <hi>outward</hi> man we are borne <hi>Children,</hi> yet that <hi>infancy</hi> comes by <hi>growth;</hi> much leſſe come we to <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> without <hi>growth.</hi> If we would attaine this that

                  <p>The <hi>ſoul</hi> is capable of <hi>growth,</hi> as well as the <hi>body,</hi> though it grow not <hi>as</hi> the body doth; the <hi>body</hi> growes by <hi>augmentation</hi> of <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and <hi>quantity,</hi> that is by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of <hi>dimenſions,</hi> the ſoule growes not ſo, there are no <hi>dimenſions,</hi> therefore there can be no <hi>extention,</hi> but it growes in <hi>habits,</hi> and <hi>qualities,</hi> habits of all <hi>kinds, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, morall, intellectuall, ſpirituall,</hi> habits of <hi>all kinds,</hi> this is the more <hi>noble</hi> growth a great deale.</p>
                  <p>This we are all to take notice of, if we be <hi>grafted</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, there will be <hi>growing</hi> up in him; if the <hi>new</hi> Creature be formed in the heart of a Chriſtian, there will be <hi>growing</hi> up in grace.

                  <p>Therefore it is laid downe by <hi>Divines</hi> well, and by <hi>all</hi> Writers, as an <hi>Axiome</hi> in Chriſtianity, that not to goe <hi>forward</hi> is to goe <hi>backward.</hi> Chriſt layes the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me, and he that gathereth not with me ſcattereth;</hi> and <hi>Leo magnus</hi> well Paraphraſeth upon it: there is no <hi>medium</hi> betweene theſe two in Chriſtianity; he that doth not <hi>profit</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing daily, it is a <hi>ſhrewd</hi> ſigne, it is a <hi>true</hi> argument that he is <hi>dificient</hi> in Chriſt: if he goe not <hi>forward,</hi> he goes <hi>backward,</hi> if he <hi>get</hi> not ſomething, he <hi>loſeth.</hi> St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> expreſſeth it by a ſweet ſimilitude.

Likewiſe when the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>Men,</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it uſeth theſe two for <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi> words, thoſe that <hi>excell</hi> in <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>excell</hi> in <hi>virtue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe as <hi>Plato</hi> well defines it, <hi>vertue,</hi> it hath a <hi>corroborating</hi> quality in it, the <hi>conſolidation,</hi> and corroboration, or <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> it is from <hi>virtue.</hi> Therefore <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> are uſed as words <hi>equivalent;</hi> ſo, eyther way we may read it. If thus, <hi>They goe on to virtue,</hi> ſo it carries a very faire conſtruction, it lets us ſee that virtue is at a <hi>diſtance.</hi> A man that will <hi>overtake</hi> virtue muſt make <hi>haſt.</hi> Virtue is out of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:114893:190"/>our <hi>reach</hi> by <hi>nature,</hi> it muſt be gotten by <hi>excerciſe,</hi> and <hi>action,</hi> and <hi>proceeding.</hi> It is pretty morall of <hi>Symonides,</hi> when he would deſcribe the <hi>Houſe of Virtue,</hi> he makes it not ſeated <hi>pleaſantly,</hi> but among <hi>Rocks,</hi> and <hi>Thornes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>hard</hi> to find. Though the <hi>fruit</hi> of vertue be <hi>ſweet,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> of virtue is full of <hi>difficulties.</hi> And the like morall <hi>Plato</hi> alludes to, when he would ſet forth that embleme that he would have before the <hi>Doore</hi> of vertue, a <hi>Picture</hi> drawne, alway <hi>ſweating,</hi> ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Doore</hi> of vertue. <hi>Clemens Allexandrinus</hi> ſayth the ſame. Becauſe it is not an <hi>ordinary</hi> motion that we are to uſe for <hi>virtue,</hi> it is not <hi>going,</hi> or <hi>walking,</hi> but <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> there muſt be making great <hi>haſt,</hi> a great <hi>contention</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> man, for a man to overtake virtue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they goe on to vertue:</hi> there is a <hi>journey</hi> to be taken.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe, they goe on to virtue, to let us ſee, that,
<q>A ſpirituall man hath virtue alway in his eye.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is the mark he aimes at; next to <hi>God,</hi> his mind is on <hi>virtue,</hi> and therefore on <hi>virtue,</hi> that he may come to God. There is nothing, next to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that a godly man prizeth more then <hi>grace;</hi> which is a thing that is not onely the <hi>conſolidation</hi> of the mind, but the <hi>beauty, O how amiable are thy Tabernacles!</hi> Thou art <hi>all faire</hi> to draw us after thee. <hi>Tullie</hi> would ſet it downe by three words of the ſame ſignification. There is nothing more <hi>amiable,</hi> and <hi>ſweet,</hi> therefore there is an inviting, <hi>attracting</hi> force in virtue. To let us ſee, that <hi>virtue</hi> is <hi>attractive,</hi> when a man ſtands at a <hi>diſtance,</hi> it drawes him forward.</p>
                  <p>But I will not read the words ſo, but take them in the ſecond conſtruction.</p>

                     <hi>Strength</hi> is a word frequently uſed in Scripture, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>enablement</hi> of grace. Sometimes we meet with the ſtrength of <hi>confidence,</hi> whereby we are able to <hi>rely</hi> upon God. So <hi>David</hi> toucheth upon that, <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength, Bleſſed is the man that makes the Lord his ſtrength.</hi> To make <hi>God</hi> our <hi>ſtrength,</hi> is to put <hi>confidence</hi> in him. There is the ſtrength of <hi>confidence.</hi> Then there is the ſtrength of <hi>conſolation,</hi> the cure of <hi>ſorrow.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>Strong conſolation.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> when he breathed after it, he expreſſeth it, <hi>I am a man of no ſtrength,</hi> that is, of no <hi>comfort.</hi> And in another place, <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength, and my portion for ever.</hi> The Lord ſhould be his <hi>Comforter:</hi> there is the ſtrength of <hi>comfort.</hi> Then, there is the ſtrength of <hi>grace,</hi> that is the enablement to goe on in vertue, and piety. It is a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> word drawne from a <hi>corporall</hi> ſignification. The firſt ſignification of it, <hi>corporall</hi> ſtrength is, the <hi>conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the whole body, or of particular <hi>parts,</hi> whereby it is enabled to execute the uſe of it. <hi>Vigour,</hi> and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidation is the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the <hi>body.</hi> So in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ſence, the vigour, and <hi>vivacity</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> whereby it is enabled to doe <hi>good,</hi> and to ſhun the contrary, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That is the difference between <hi>corporall,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall</hi> motion, corporall motion <hi>adds</hi> not, but takes <hi>away</hi> from, unleſſe it be <hi>moderate,</hi> if there be <hi>over much</hi> labour, and motion. But in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ſence, there is no motion ſo <hi>great,</hi> and faſt, and <hi>full</hi> of labour, but it <hi>adds</hi> ſtrength;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:114893:191"/>
                     <hi>the faſter</hi> we move, the more <hi>ſtrength</hi> we get; therefore <hi>they goe on to ſtrength,</hi> for the very <hi>ſtrength</hi> is increaſed by <hi>motion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then take the other, <hi>they grow up by ſtrength. Strength</hi> is gotten by <hi>growth:</hi> men come not to ſtrength in an <hi>inſtant;</hi> we are not <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> at once. No more is it in Chriſtianity, no man is <hi>borne,</hi> and made <hi>ſtrong</hi> at the <hi>ſame</hi> time, but we are firſt <hi>Babes</hi> in Chriſt, and then <hi>men.</hi> Indeed in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, when grace was infuſed <hi>immediately,</hi> then God ſet examples of thoſe that were <hi>ſtrong</hi> in Chriſt, and <hi>begotten</hi> to him at the <hi>ſame</hi> time, <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>men. Paul</hi> in his Converſion, at the ſame time was a <hi>Babe,</hi> and a <hi>man;</hi> and others that had the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Spirit, though miraculouſly. But it is not ſo <hi>now,</hi> there are <hi>many</hi> ſpaces between theſe two, a <hi>Babe</hi> in Chriſt, and a <hi>ſtrong</hi> man, there muſt be the <hi>ages</hi> of <hi>growth</hi> muſt be gone through. So now, to <hi>grow to ſtrength,</hi> is to grow to <hi>ſtature,</hi> for ſtature is the <hi>baſis</hi> of ſtrength, and <hi>age</hi> is the <hi>way</hi> to ſtature. So, here now is the thing, <hi>they grow up to ſtrength,</hi> that is, to ſpirituall <hi>ſtature,</hi> to <hi>man-hood,</hi> to theſe <hi>great</hi> enablements. Here is that we are to take notice of.</p>
                  <q>It is not enough to grow, but to grow up ſenſibly to that ſtate and ſtrength as whereby we may be more enabled to doe God more ſervice.</q>
                  <p>To doe <hi>more</hi> work, and to diſpatch it with <hi>chearfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> It is that aime, that is laid in all ſorts of <hi>conditions,</hi> and things: in <hi>civill</hi> things it holds, a man is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be of a Trade, but he would thrive in it. In <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> things it holds, in <hi>Plants,</hi> firſt there is <hi>ſeed,</hi> and then it is <hi>ſowne,</hi> and then it takes <hi>root,</hi> and then it <hi>ſprings,</hi> and ſpreads, and flowers, and <hi>growes</hi> up till it come to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:114893:192"/>
                     <hi>ſeed</hi> againe, and yeilds increaſe. So, theſe <hi>ſteps</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees there are in Chriſtianity, there is <hi>being,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>ſtature.</hi> Theſe degrees hang one upon another; there cannot be <hi>ſtrength,</hi> unleſſe there be <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> nor that without <hi>growth,</hi> nor that without <hi>life,</hi> nor that without <hi>being</hi> in Chriſt. So, <hi>being</hi> is the <hi>firſt</hi> ſtep, and <hi>ſtrength</hi> is the <hi>pitch:</hi> becauſe it is, either <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> it ſelfe, or the <hi>next</hi> ſtep to perfection.</p>
                  <p>So, here is the Uſe that we are to make of this point, to labour to underſtand our <hi>need</hi> of <hi>ſtrength,</hi> we are thoſe that muſt ſet this aime of <hi>getting</hi> ſpirituall <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and ſo we would if we underſtood our ſelves: for we are moſt of us in a condition of <hi>weakneſſe;</hi> and thoſe that are of a <hi>ſtronger</hi> growth, yet they are as a man of a good conſtitution, ſubject many times to <hi>infirmities: ſtronger</hi> Chriſtians have <hi>many</hi> weakneſſes, and <hi>infirmities.</hi> There is <hi>no weakneſſe,</hi> or infirmity, that is <hi>pleaſing</hi> to a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> or that can be pleaſing to <hi>God. Paul</hi> tells us of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and he <hi>gloried</hi> in them, but they tended not to <hi>ſin,</hi> but were thoſe that the <hi>World</hi> accounted infirmities, <hi>tribulations</hi> whereby he brought <hi>glory</hi> to God; but if they be infirmities of <hi>ſin,</hi> if we did know the danger of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>ſhip-wrack,</hi> it would make us love <hi>ſtrength,</hi> to <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome</hi> theſe infirmities.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:114893:193"/>that he may be enabled ſo to doe, he muſt get ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>ſtrength,</hi> that he may fight, not onely with <hi>Beaſts,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but with <hi>hunger,</hi> and <hi>thirſt,</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi> and <hi>impediments</hi> in his Journey, becauſe we are <hi>Viatores,</hi> we muſt have <hi>ſtrength</hi> to accommodate us to that <hi>journey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, another eſtate we are in here, we are not onely as <hi>Travellers,</hi> but <hi>Souldiers;</hi> and our Enemies are <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> not onely <hi>Companies,</hi> but <hi>Armies;</hi> as many as there are <hi>Tribulations,</hi> and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> to be endured in the World, as many as there are <hi>Temptations</hi> to ſeduce us to ſin, as many as there are ſeverall <hi>ſins</hi> to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; for theſe are the <hi>great</hi> Enemies; as many as there are <hi>Spirits</hi> in the <hi>Aire,</hi> and <hi>Devills</hi> in <hi>Hell;</hi> and theſe are <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> Enemies. To let us ſee, that they are <hi>ſtrong</hi> Enemies, they are called <hi>Principallities, and Powers,</hi> and to ſhew that they are many, they are called <hi>Legions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, the multitude of <hi>ſins</hi> that a man muſt take heed of, that are like the <hi>Hydra's</hi> heads, cut off <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> ſtarts up. <hi>Cyprian</hi> well deſcribes it; ſaith he, if a man be ſo happy as to cut off one <hi>Hidra's</hi> head, <hi>Coveteouſneſſe, another</hi> will come in the roome of it, if he take not heede, there will come <hi>Luſt,</hi> and <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe,</hi> and if he cut off <hi>that,</hi> if he take not heed, there will come <hi>malice,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>ambition,</hi> and if he cut off theſe, if he take not heed, there wil come up more; all theſe are to be encountered with ſpirituall <hi>ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, there are many <hi>Tribulations</hi> in the World, and which is the <hi>worſt</hi> affliction in the World, the many <hi>delights,</hi> and <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>vanities</hi> of the World, which we account not <hi>Enemies,</hi> but <hi>friends,</hi> yet theſe are to be <hi>overcome.</hi> There is more danger in theſe
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:114893:193"/>then in the <hi>hardneſſe,</hi> and Tribulations of the <hi>World.</hi> We have more cauſe to feare the <hi>baits</hi> of the World then the <hi>threatnings,</hi> the <hi>allurements,</hi> then the <hi>diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the World. It deales with us both wayes. If the World plant <hi>Thornes</hi> in our way, the danger is not great becauſe it is <hi>ſeene,</hi> but if it ſtrew <hi>flowers,</hi> it is not <hi>obſerved,</hi> it is more dangerous. It takes hold of both; the Devill layes both to keep us from piety. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the World lets fall a <hi>golden</hi> Apple. Sometimes it layes <hi>Snares,</hi> and ſets <hi>pits</hi> in the way. Sometimes it perſues a man with <hi>clamours.</hi> Sometimes it ſings a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renean</hi> Song, that lulls him a ſleep in <hi>ſecurity;</hi> here is the <hi>greateſt</hi> danger, but there is danger in <hi>both,</hi> and we have need of <hi>ſtrength</hi> to overcome both, as <hi>Cyrill</hi> ſayth well, he had need be a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Chriſtian that muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>rough</hi> hewne way; but I tell you he had need be a <hi>ſtronger</hi> Chriſtian that will overcome the <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and delights, and <hi>enticements</hi> of the World; <hi>ſtrength</hi> is ſpecially required for that.</p>
                  <p>Put it together, having ſo <hi>many</hi> Enemies, ſo <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and ſo <hi>buſie,</hi> we have need not onely of ſtore of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> wiſdome, but of <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and that <hi>ſtrengh</hi> comes by <hi>growth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having now put all theſe together, I hope I need not uſe any Exhortation to make you in love with that which is the <hi>improvement</hi> of all other graces, <hi>Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> I told you before, <hi>ſtrength</hi> enableth to <hi>perſevere,</hi> and that we may perſevere we muſt get ſtrength, the one enableth to the other; by <hi>perſeverance</hi> we get ſtrength, and by <hi>ſtrength</hi> we <hi>perſevere. Thou therefore my Son be ſtrong in the grace that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We had need to labour to get <hi>ſtrength,</hi> we know not what <hi>evill</hi> dayes <hi>haſten</hi> upon us, and every Chriſtian that is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Temptation,</hi> hath the <hi>feare</hi> of an evill time upon him.</p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:114893:194"/>
                  <p>We know not what <hi>Monſters</hi> God may call us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with, <hi>Principallities,</hi> and <hi>powers.</hi> O now we have time, let us ſtore up <hi>ſtrength</hi> while we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to come to the houſe of God. The end of our comming here, beſides giving <hi>glory</hi> to God, and <hi>calling</hi> upon his name, and <hi>worſhipping</hi> of him, is to get <hi>ſtrength.</hi> This houſe it is <hi>Beth-lehem,</hi> the houſe of ſpirituall <hi>bread.</hi> Bread is that that ſtrengthens man. It is the houſe where the myſteries of Salvation are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, that we may get ſpirituall enablement, as <hi>Baſile</hi> ſayth, it is the <hi>School-houſe</hi> of the knowledge of God. Let us make this <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of it, propound this end to our ſelves in comming hither, make this uſe of it, to <hi>ſtore</hi> up, and get this <hi>ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>houſe</hi> it ſelfe, ſo the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, is the <hi>Table</hi> of ſpirituall <hi>refreſhing,</hi> the Table of ſpirituall ſtrength. The other Sacrament gives us <hi>initiation,</hi> into <hi>CHRIST,</hi> our <hi>growth</hi> in Chriſt, and our ſtrength is by repairing to the Table of the Lord. Therefore it was inſtituted by Chriſt, that by this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Banquet and refection we might <hi>grow</hi> up in ſtrength. Then let us labour to make this uſe of the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> that we may be <hi>built,</hi> and <hi>grow</hi> up to a <hi>perfect</hi> man, that we may draw ſpirituall <hi>ſtrength</hi> daily from both. And when we have gotten <hi>ſome ſtrength,</hi> not to <hi>ſtay</hi> there, but to get <hi>more,</hi> and then <hi>more,</hi> never to <hi>ſtay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is the next point, not onely to <hi>grow</hi> in ſtrength, but ſtill to excell in <hi>motion,</hi> and <hi>perpetuation, They goe on from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> in the <hi>reduplication</hi> of the word. But thus much for this time.</p>

And indeed ſo it is, that ſome Tranſlators read the words, whereas we read, <hi>From ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> they, <hi>From Doctrine to Doctrine;</hi> they goe from <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that is, from <hi>Edification</hi> to <hi>Edification.</hi> It very well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Context, for but two Verſes before, there you have the Pſalmiſt pronouncing a bleſſing to thoſe that dwell in Gods houſe, <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe,</hi> and the Houſe of God is <hi>Domus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinae,</hi> the Houſe of Doctrine, or <hi>Edification.</hi> So, from
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:114893:195"/>
                     <hi>ſtrength</hi> to <hi>ſtrength,</hi> is as much as our <hi>ſecond</hi> Aſſemblie, from <hi>Meeting,</hi> to <hi>Meeting.</hi> It is that very Houſe in which we are now met together. Therefore ſeeing I have ſhewed you the <hi>firſt</hi> Doctrines, conteined in the <hi>former</hi> part, the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>motion, they goe on to ſtrength.</hi> You will give me now leave to proceed to the other Doctrines, that follow in the ſecond part, that is, the <hi>continuation</hi> of the <hi>motion;</hi> it is,
<q>From ſtrength to ſtrength.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the underſtanding of that. Firſt, I will let you ſee briefly the <hi>nature,</hi> and property of the phraſe, what <hi>ſignification,</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> it hath; and I cannot doe that better then by <hi>paralell</hi> places, and there are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this nature that I meet with in Scripture. There is one in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>We are changed into the Image of God,</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle,) <hi>from glory to glory.</hi> That is, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> very well Expounds it, from a <hi>leſſe</hi> glory, to a <hi>greater,</hi> and ſo to a <hi>greater g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ory,</hi> &amp; ſo to the <hi>fullneſs,</hi> which is in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Or, from <hi>glory</hi> to <hi>glory,</hi> that is, from the <hi>firſt</hi> glory of the <hi>Creation,</hi> to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> greater glory of <hi>juſtification;</hi> from the glory that we <hi>have,</hi> to the glory that we <hi>looke</hi> for, from the glory of <hi>faith,</hi> to the glory of <hi>Viſion.</hi> That is one place.</p>
                  <p>Then you have another which is given us by the ſame Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>From faith to faith. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God is revealed from faith to faith.</hi> That is, eyther as <hi>Theophilact</hi> very well gloſſeth upon it, from <hi>one degree</hi> of faith to <hi>another;</hi> becauſe <hi>faith</hi> is firſt in <hi>Semine,</hi> and after grows up to a <hi>greater</hi> ſtate, from <hi>faith,</hi> to <hi>faith;</hi> that is, from the <hi>beginning</hi> of faith, to the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and accompliſhment of it. Or elſe as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> further enlargeth it, from the <hi>faith</hi> that is of things <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:114893:195"/>to the faith of things to <hi>come;</hi> or from a <hi>leſſe</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>faith</hi> that the <hi>Fathers</hi> had under the <hi>Law</hi> (that alſo beleived in Chriſt) to the <hi>greater</hi> meaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us in the time of the <hi>Goſpell; from faith to faith.</hi> It is all one with that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>From Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to Generation;</hi> that is, to <hi>all</hi> Generations. Now from theſe three reduplications we may well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of the Text. As in one place it is ſaid, <hi>We are changed from glory to glory;</hi> that is, from <hi>all aſcents</hi> to glory, till we come to <hi>fullneſſe.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the revelation of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, is from <hi>faith</hi> to <hi>faith,</hi> that is, through <hi>all the degrees</hi> of faith, till we come to the <hi>pitch.</hi> In the third, the <hi>name</hi> of God is ſaid to be magnified from <hi>Generation to Generation,</hi> that is, through <hi>all</hi> generations to the <hi>Worlds end.</hi> So, here the Saints are ſaid to grow <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> that is, to paſſe through <hi>all degrees</hi> of ſtrength, till they come to be <hi>perfect</hi> men, and as neare as they can attaine in this World, to the pitch, and period of <hi>perfection.</hi> Here you have the meaning of the word, what it is, <hi>From ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi> There is ſomething <hi>limitted,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>unlimitted,</hi> to both we muſt have reference, it is <hi>definite</hi> in the <hi>phraſe,</hi> it is <hi>indefinite</hi> in the <hi>ſignification.</hi> For though there be but <hi>two</hi> words uſed, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſo many <hi>thouſands.</hi> If any man ask, I have attained <hi>ſome</hi> ſtrength what ſhall I doe <hi>now?</hi> Goe <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and yet <hi>further.</hi> As in our <hi>life,</hi> from <hi>houre</hi> to <hi>houre,</hi> from <hi>day,</hi> to <hi>day,</hi> from <hi>age,</hi> to <hi>age:</hi> ſo there muſt be a <hi>growth</hi> from <hi>one</hi> pitch of perfection to <hi>another,</hi> till as neare as we can we come to the <hi>utmoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But having done with the <hi>meaning</hi> of the phraſe let us ſee what is the <hi>extent,</hi> and Doctrinall <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the words themſelves; and the <hi>Scope</hi> of the Pſalmiſt in theſe. For, as I told you before, <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:114893:196"/>is as much as from <hi>vertue,</hi> to <hi>vertue.</hi> Or if you joyne both words, from the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> to the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of <hi>greater vertue.</hi> And <hi>vertue</hi> is conſiderable one of theſe waye
<list>
                        <item>There is <hi>vertue</hi> in the <hi>Habit,</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>There is <hi>vertue</hi> in the <hi>Act,</hi>

                        <item>There is <hi>vertue</hi> in the <hi>Degree.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>According to theſe three, there are three <hi>extents,</hi> or latitudes of the word, or rather foure, that will give us now the full ſignification of it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the <hi>latitude,</hi> or extent of the word in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>habits</hi> of grace. <hi>From ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> that is, from one <hi>habite</hi> of grace, to another habite of grace, that when we have attained the pitch, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of <hi>any</hi> grace, we ſhould not content our ſelves with that, there are <hi>other</hi> graces to be attained. That as a man that will learne perfectly to <hi>read,</hi> muſt goe through the whole liſt, and <hi>Alphabet</hi> of Letters, and none are to be <hi>excepted:</hi> So he that will come to take out the <hi>whole</hi> leſſon of Chriſtianity, muſt ſet out the <hi>whole</hi> leſſon, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and <hi>Sillables,</hi> the whole <hi>quire</hi> of grace, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to come to a competent meaſure, and <hi>perfection</hi> of habits in <hi>all.</hi> When he hath got <hi>one,</hi> he muſt not reſt there, but goe on from the habit of one grace to <hi>another.</hi> Becauſe <hi>all</hi> grace upon occaſion <hi>brings</hi> glory to God. And a Chriſtian hath <hi>need</hi> in this World of <hi>every</hi> grace. And <hi>every</hi> grace leads alike to the <hi>ſame</hi> excellency of <hi>glory,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and Reward is ſtated upon it.</p>
                  <p>How ever it is true, as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſayth well, ſome <hi>perticular</hi> graces, are more proper to ſome perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>eſtates,</hi> and <hi>ages</hi> of men. <hi>Repentance</hi> is a grace more proper to them that are <hi>fallen,</hi> and <hi>perſeverance</hi> is a grace
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:114893:196"/>more proper to them that <hi>ſtand.</hi> A man that is <hi>downe</hi> cannot be called to <hi>perſevere,</hi> he is not yet <hi>raiſed;</hi> but a man that is <hi>up,</hi> his <hi>proper</hi> grace, that hath his footing already ſet in Chriſtianity, is to exhort him to <hi>perſevere,</hi> and to exhort the other to <hi>riſe.</hi> So <hi>Almſ-deeds,</hi> it is a grace that is more proper to him that is <hi>Rich,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation</hi> to the <hi>Poore.</hi> Call to a <hi>poore</hi> man for <hi>Alms,</hi> he hath the <hi>Alms</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> not of <hi>releife,</hi> it is not a grace ſo proper.</p>
                  <p>To carry it further, <hi>Modeſtie,</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> they are graces proper to them that are <hi>young; wiſdome</hi> and <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> and <hi>diſcretion,</hi> are graces proper to them that are in <hi>yeares,</hi> that are <hi>old. Thankfullneſſe</hi> is a proper grace for him that abounds in <hi>proſperity;</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per grace for him that is in <hi>adverſity.</hi> So <hi>Nazienzen</hi> ſayth well, there are graces more <hi>proper,</hi> and <hi>peculiar,</hi> to certaine <hi>conditions</hi> of men. But this hinders not, but that <hi>every</hi> grace is <hi>needfull,</hi> and neceſſary to <hi>all.</hi> Becauſe <hi>every man,</hi> may be ſet in <hi>every eſtate;</hi> he that <hi>ſtands</hi> now, may <hi>fall;</hi> he that hath <hi>plentifully,</hi> and therefore may <hi>give Almes,</hi> he may <hi>want,</hi> and be called to <hi>contentation.</hi> There is no Chriſtian, but he hath need of <hi>every</hi> grace, becauſe he may be ſet in <hi>every</hi> condition, and <hi>eſtate;</hi> therefore it is not enough to attaine ſome one grace, and to neglect the other, to mortifie ſome one <hi>Vice,</hi> and fall into <hi>another,</hi> that ſtands not with the nature of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> to attaine to ſome one <hi>vertue</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>another,</hi> it ſtands not with the ſtate of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after <hi>perfection.</hi> For a man to ſubdue <hi>pride,</hi> and keep <hi>covetouſneſſe,</hi> or to ſubdue <hi>covetouſneſſe,</hi> and keep <hi>envie,</hi> and malice, each of theſe make him <hi>equally</hi> abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to God. For a man to attaine to the habit of <hi>charity,</hi> and not to ſtudy the grace of <hi>repentance,</hi> or to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the grace of <hi>repentance,</hi> and not to give accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture calls ever and anon, that we be <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in every good worke;</hi> to labour, to <hi>pleaſe God in all things</hi> we doe. <hi>Whatſoever things are juſt;</hi> what!

                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly tells us of theſe junctures, <hi>Add to knowledge temperance, to temperance patience, to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience godlineſſe, to godlineſſe brotherly kindneſſe, to brotherly kindneſſe, love.</hi> Here are now the ſeverall <hi>paces,</hi> and <hi>ſteps;</hi> theſe are the <hi>habits</hi> of vertues; it is all one, as if he had ſaid in the words of the Pſalmiſt, Add <hi>ſtrength to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:114893:197"/>ſtrength, virtue</hi> to <hi>virtue, habite</hi> to <hi>habite.</hi> He names them ſeverally, to ſhew, that if it were poſſible to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the <hi>perfection</hi> of ſome <hi>one,</hi> we muſt not <hi>ſtay</hi> there, from <hi>habite</hi> to <hi>habite,</hi> that is, <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength:</hi> That is the firſt latitude.</p>
                  <p>Next, to proceed from the <hi>habites</hi> to the <hi>acts</hi> of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, habites are <hi>dry,</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi> if they ſhew not themſelves in <hi>acts,</hi> they may glorify God <hi>within,</hi> but they cannot <hi>without,</hi> further then they manifeſt themſelves in <hi>action.</hi> Therefore the next, <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> is, from the <hi>habite,</hi> to the <hi>act.</hi> Admit a man attaine all the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> of grace named, if thoſe graces be perfect in reſpect of him, they are not in reſpect of <hi>God;</hi> action is the <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> of thoſe graces that glorifies God, and brings the knowledge and <hi>improvement</hi> of them. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in one place againſt the Heathens, that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> virtues far excell the <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rall</hi> virtues of the Heathen, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the very name they are called; ſayth he, you call your virtues <hi>habits,</hi> we call ours <hi>gifts,</hi> you aſcribe it to your <hi>ſelves,</hi> and therefore you call them <hi>habits</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you <hi>have</hi> them, but we call them gifts, becauſe we <hi>receive</hi> them from God, <hi>Every good gift is from above.</hi> And indeed it was a very good argument that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſed; yet there is a third word may be taken that is better then both; that is, <hi>Practiſe.</hi> For whither we conſider them as <hi>habits,</hi> or <hi>gifts,</hi> they are not perfect till they come to <hi>action.</hi> It is not the <hi>having,</hi> but the <hi>husbanding</hi> of a grace, that brings glory to God, for a man to <hi>have</hi> the <hi>habit,</hi> and not to put it in <hi>practiſe,</hi> it is all one as a Talent in a <hi>Napkin.</hi> Therefore the Scripture in ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, uſeth thoſe two words promiſcuouſly. <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance. Having</hi> is <hi>uſing,</hi> for the <hi>unfaithfull</hi> Servant had a Talent, but he did not <hi>uſe</hi> it; And then follows, <hi>But from him that hath not
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:114893:198"/>ſhall be taken that that he hath.</hi> How can that be <hi>taken</hi> away that he hath <hi>not?</hi> He is ſaid not to <hi>have</hi> it, becauſe he did not <hi>uſe</hi> it. It is the ſame, from him that hath not <hi>uſed</hi> it ſhall be taken away that he hath. So the Scripture runs ſtill. <hi>God</hi> gives the <hi>grace,</hi> and he muſt have the <hi>glory</hi> of his grace, and that is gotten by <hi>action.</hi> Otherwiſe, as <hi>Plinie</hi> obſerves well of <hi>Phydeus</hi> the famous Painter, that had the <hi>habite</hi> of the Art, above all of his time: ſayth he, that great Art, and skill that <hi>Phideus</hi> had, it was to no purpoſe, unleſſe he had <hi>excerciſed,</hi> and <hi>practiſed</hi> it upon ſome Table. So it is with the <hi>graces,</hi> and virtues of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> if he <hi>apply</hi> them not, &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate them to <hi>uſe,</hi> and occaſion, that God may get <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> it is all one, as <hi>a Candle under a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or in <hi>obedience,</hi> it cannot be called obedience, for that is full of <hi>action,</hi> but what is <hi>obedience,</hi> if there be no <hi>excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi> and practiſe of obedience? Here is the ſecond lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when we have got the <hi>habite,</hi> we are not come to <hi>perfection,</hi> there muſt <hi>action</hi> follow. <hi>Knowledge</hi> availes not, without <hi>practiſe,</hi> we muſt goe therfore <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> from <hi>knowledge</hi> to <hi>practiſe,</hi> from <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> to <hi>uſe,</hi> from <hi>habite</hi> to <hi>act;</hi> that is, <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi>

                  <p>Beſides this, there is a <hi>third,</hi> and I will add a <hi>fourth,</hi> and put them together. Beſides <hi>habits,</hi> and <hi>acts,</hi> there is a conſideration of <hi>degrees,</hi> and <hi>multiplying</hi> of acts; ſo the third, and fourth conſideration, is from <hi>one</hi> action of Piety to <hi>another;</hi> ſtay not in <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> but ſtill goe on. That is to be <hi>fruitfull,</hi> and when we have attained <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>two</hi> degrees, if grace <hi>stay</hi> not, but goe <hi>further,</hi> that is to climb up. That is the rule the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſets in <hi>Phillip.</hi> 3. <hi>He preſſed forward to the mark.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> got a <hi>great</hi> maſtery, and conqueſt over Errour, and ſin, and made a <hi>great progreſſe</hi> in the way of Piety, none ever came nearer <hi>perfection,</hi> then St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and at that time, when he wrote, he was ſtill in <hi>motion,</hi> and <hi>action,</hi> yet ſtill he did goe <hi>forward,</hi> ſtep, after ſtep, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with no <hi>mediocrity, I preſſe towards the mark, I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> for the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>race.</hi> There is the ſame in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. he bids them <hi>goe on to perfection;</hi> there muſt be a proceeding. It is well expreſſed in <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. <hi>He that is holy, let him be holy still, he that is righteous, let him be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſtill.</hi> What! ſhall we think it is onely meant of <hi>perſeverance,</hi> to keep at the <hi>ſame</hi> ſtay, in the ſame <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe? That is not it, but it adds the <hi>degrees,</hi> the <hi>multiplied</hi> acts, he that is <hi>holy,</hi> let him be <hi>more</hi> holy, and he that is <hi>righteous,</hi> let him be <hi>more</hi> righteous. Theſe are the <hi>degrees</hi> of grace, by which we muſt aſcend to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>If any aſke me how <hi>many,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> thoſe <hi>Degrees</hi> are?</p>
                  <p>That Queſtion cannot be reſolved by any, <hi>who can tell the duſt of Jacob?</hi> I will not ſay as it is in one place of Scripture, you may as well number the <hi>duſt</hi> of the earth, for there is nothing of Earth in grace, but I ſay as God ſaid to <hi>Jacob, See if thou canſt tell the Starrs in the skie;</hi> we may as eaſily number the <hi>Stars</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> as number
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:114893:199"/>the <hi>degrees</hi> of the aſcents of <hi>grace,</hi> that carries up to it. For if they be not ſo <hi>great,</hi> and ſo <hi>many,</hi> the degrees of grace; yet thus far, who can tell the <hi>ſteps</hi> of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? There is a Ladder <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> better then that that he ſaw, the ſeverall <hi>ſteps</hi> that lead to <hi>Heaven,</hi> it is as hard to number them as the ſteps of that. It is true, ſome of the Fathers have gone about for our better direction, to give us an account of ſome numbers of degrees. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in one or two places names <hi>fifteene</hi> degrees of aſcent to <hi>perfection,</hi> in the ſcale of perfection, anſwerable to the fifteene degrees that carryed up to the Sanctuary. But they are far more, therefore <hi>Johannes Climachus</hi> dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the number, he makes the degrees <hi>thirty,</hi> but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly ſhort: for there are a <hi>greater</hi> number of graces, and virtues, and there are <hi>twiſe</hi> as many degrees of every grace. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> reckons <hi>ſeaven</hi> degrees of <hi>humility,</hi> that is but <hi>one</hi> grace of the quire, what doe you think are the <hi>multitudes</hi> of degrees of the reſt? And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that he names, are the degrees that he conceives have been <hi>attained,</hi> who can tell the degrees that have <hi>not</hi> been <hi>attained?</hi> Therefore ſtay this queſtion, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are <hi>not</hi> to be numbred, but goe on, it is an <hi>indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> as I told you.</p>
                  <p>But what <hi>encouragement</hi> is there? If there be no <hi>period</hi> that is an <hi>endleſſe</hi> work, and that that is <hi>endleſſe</hi> affords no <hi>comfort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, it is not <hi>endleſſe</hi> as <hi>Statius</hi> ſaith of an <hi>Old</hi> man that was buſie in <hi>planting,</hi> when one aſked the reaſon why <hi>Old</hi> men ſhould <hi>plant,</hi> they plant Trees in the earth, whither <hi>themſelves</hi> are going, they are never like to eat of the fruit: And <hi>who plants a Vineyard and doth not eat of the fruit of it?</hi> O but ſayth he, they doe good for <hi>ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> they plant Trees that may profit <hi>another</hi> age. So, a Chriſtian, admit he doe not come to the <hi>top,</hi> to the

                     <hi>higheſt</hi> degree in this <hi>World,</hi> we plant grace that may bring us to <hi>another</hi> age, that may bring <hi>comfort,</hi> and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Heaven.</hi> We doe not look to <hi>reap</hi> the fruit of our labours <hi>here,</hi> admit the <hi>pitch</hi> of all, be not attained to <hi>here,</hi> it is reſerved for <hi>Heaven; here</hi> we <hi>dig,</hi> that <hi>there</hi> we may <hi>reap</hi> the fruit. But God of purpoſe hath ſet <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> out of our reach, that we may ſtill be <hi>proficients,</hi> and goe on <hi>forward,</hi> and labour after it.</p>
                  <p>It is not with the growth of the <hi>mind,</hi> as it is with the <hi>body;</hi> in the growth of the body there is a <hi>peculiar</hi> ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſet, a <hi>height,</hi> and <hi>pitch</hi> of every Creature, there is no Creature that is capable of <hi>growth,</hi> but hath a <hi>pitch.</hi> In the life of man there are thoſe three ſtates of <hi>growing, keeping,</hi> and <hi>looſing.</hi> Firſt, we <hi>grow</hi> till we come to a <hi>pitch,</hi> and then we doe not preſently <hi>decline,</hi> but there is a time to <hi>keep</hi> that we have got; that expired, we come to <hi>decline,</hi> and <hi>loſe.</hi> So it is in all <hi>Creatures, plants,</hi> and <hi>living</hi> Creatures, and <hi>man,</hi> there is a <hi>ſtature</hi> ſet. Onely the Naturaliſts obſerve, that the <hi>Crokadile</hi> hath <hi>no</hi> pitch; they ſay of that, it <hi>growes</hi> as long as it <hi>lives:</hi> therefore ſome of them come to an <hi>incredible</hi> magnitude; but all other Creatures have a <hi>ſtature</hi> ſet. It is not ſo in the growth of the <hi>mind,</hi> there is no <hi>ſtature,</hi> or <hi>period,</hi> but when a man hath gotten the <hi>greateſt</hi> fullneſſe as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, there is ſtill <hi>ſome</hi> peice of work to <hi>doe,</hi> there is an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra,</hi> ſomthing to be <hi>added</hi> further. When he hath gotten never ſo much <hi>knowledge,</hi> there is ſomwhat of <hi>learning,</hi> and knowledge that is not <hi>perfect</hi> till he come to <hi>Heaven,</hi> when he hath the <hi>higheſt</hi> pitch. As we <hi>know in part,</hi> ſo <hi>faith</hi> is in <hi>part,</hi> it is <hi>weake</hi> faith, the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> faith it is capable of ſome <hi>addition,</hi> and increaſe. There is an <hi>

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:114893:200"/>that we <hi>have not,</hi> we muſt <hi>advance</hi> to that that we have not. There was no Apoſtle, or Prophet (and they were the Creatures that came <hi>neareſt</hi> the perfection of grace in the World) that ever attained to ſuch a <hi>pitch,</hi> but ſtill they would climb <hi>higher,</hi> and come <hi>further;</hi> and they each of them had their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra.</hi> As <hi>Gregory Nicene</hi> ſayth well, every man hath <hi>ſomthing</hi> that he may yet <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,</hi> and repaire his decays; there is ſomwhat more to be <hi>gotten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is the iſſue of the Point, ſince there be no perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>degree</hi> we can ſet to our ſelves, the Scripture calls on us ſtill to <hi>grow,</hi> and goe <hi>forward,</hi> and climb <hi>higher, from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> from <hi>one</hi> act of righteouſneſſe to <hi>another,</hi> and ſo to <hi>another;</hi> here is <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi> Here is the laſt <hi>latitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But indeed it is a Doctrine we are not much acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with; in the <hi>Theorie</hi> we are, for we can hardly be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it: but in <hi>excerciſe,</hi> to look for <hi>growth,</hi> or to care to advance to theſe <hi>pitches</hi> of ſtrength, few men look after it. The <hi>growth</hi> of Chriſtians in the World is very <hi>ſmall,</hi> ſhall we not think it an injury done to theſe <hi>times,</hi> and to this <hi>age</hi> of the Church? Though ſomthing may be pleaded, put thoſe pleas, and ſee whither it be not an evident thing now in the latter times of the world, the <hi>charity,</hi> and zeale of men are <hi>cold,</hi> and ſmall, and there is little care to <hi>Grow from strength to ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, one <hi>plea</hi> that may be alledged, is this, ſurely there is a great <hi>pitch,</hi> and <hi>ſtature</hi> of vertue, and grace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men now, becauſe they <hi>equalize</hi> the ſtature of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> times.</p>
                  <p>No, that is not ſo, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh, I have not attained to the age of my Fathers.</hi> In theſe <hi>declining</hi> times of the Church, we doe not attaine to the <hi>ſtature</hi> of our <hi>Fathers.</hi> There are not thoſe <hi>Maſculine</hi> heroick Saints,

                  </p>
                  <p>I will not urge it there, it may be you think that you are not to expect to come ſo <hi>high,</hi> to come to their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtature, they were <hi>Giants,</hi> men of <hi>great</hi> ſtature.</p>
                  <p>Nay, we have not attained the ſtature of <hi>inferiour</hi> Saints, that have beene but a <hi>little</hi> before us; there is leſſe conſcience by farr, and leſſe <hi>uprightneſſe,</hi> and <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,</hi> and leſſe <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> love of our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and more love of the <hi>World</hi> by farr, then in the <hi>age</hi> that is but in our <hi>memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas Hiſtorians make a great queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>ſtature</hi> of men, and it is diſputed both wayes, whither the ſtature of men now, be not <hi>leſſe</hi> then in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; though ſomething be ſaid both wayes, yet it is the generall Opinion of the Ancients, <hi>Plinie,</hi> and <hi>Angelius,</hi> and he quotes <hi>Homer</hi> that in his time the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men was not ſo great as in former times. Be it ſo, or no, concerning the <hi>corporall</hi> ſtature, I am ſure it is ſo concerning our <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ſtature; we come far <hi>ſhort</hi> of that <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and luſtre of <hi>piety,</hi> we doe not bring ſo <hi>much</hi> glory to God, though our meanes be <hi>better</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time of the Church, we doe not come neer any <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of them; we are <hi>dwarfs</hi> in grace, in reſpect of them, we come far ſhort.

                  <p>But, though we attaine not the ſtature of others, yet we have a <hi>competent</hi> ſtature of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Not ſo neither, men doe not <hi>looke</hi> to <hi>ſtature,</hi> they doe not delight to <hi>excell;</hi> if they get a little <hi>formallity,</hi> and <hi>ſemblance</hi> of ſome grace, to be <hi>accounted</hi> ſuch, and ſuch in the World, this is the greateſt <hi>pitch</hi> that men look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; here is the <hi>Worlds perfection,</hi> as <hi>Lucetius</hi> ſayth of

So, we ſet up <hi>great</hi> Statues, and <hi>Trophees,</hi> but our <hi>ſtature</hi> is <hi>ſmall,</hi> like <hi>Zacheus,</hi> there is little <hi>faith,</hi> little <hi>piety,</hi> we are of ſuch <hi>low</hi> ſtature that we can hardly <hi>reach</hi> to the ſight of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Therefore that will not ſerve, we have hardly any <hi>competence</hi> of ſtature in our ſelves, ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> are we of thoſe that are gone <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> But in the third place, our meanes of growth are not ſo <hi>great,</hi> if men have not <hi>convenient</hi> nouriſhment, and thoſe <hi>opportunities</hi> that may further <hi>ſtature,</hi> it cannot be expected. Nay, that will not ſerve neyther, our <hi>meanes</hi> of growth are <hi>many;</hi> there is far more <hi>Preaching</hi> of the word <hi>now,</hi> then hath been in <hi>former</hi> times. VVe have our <hi>weekly</hi> repaire at leaſt to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of God, our <hi>monethly</hi> repaire to the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, in both theſe there is ſpirituall refection, and opportunity of ſtrength. We come often, <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Seaven</hi> times in the Yeare, to the <hi>one,</hi> and may come <hi>often</hi> in the <hi>Weeke</hi> to the other. VVere our condition ſo with our <hi>bodies,</hi> we would think that we were in a <hi>deſperate</hi> eſtate, that we ſhould <hi>feed</hi> hard, and have <hi>plenty</hi> of nouriſhment, and great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and <hi>Cordialls,</hi> and the like, and yet no <hi>ſtrength,</hi> nor <hi>growth,</hi> certainly we would conclude that that man were in a <hi>Conſumption.</hi> It is ſo with us, we have <hi>opportunity,</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> to <hi>thrive,</hi> and yet as I ſaid
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:114893:201"/>before, we are <hi>Dwarfs</hi> to them that were <hi>before</hi> us, and yet we ſtand upon their <hi>Shoulders.</hi> A <hi>Dwarfe</hi> that ſtands upon a <hi>Giants</hi> ſhoulders, may ſee <hi>further</hi> then the Giant can, we ſtand upon their Shoulders, and yet we ſee not <hi>halfe</hi> ſo far as they; notwithſtanding all the <hi>meanes</hi> of grace, we come to nothing in <hi>growth</hi> and perfection.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, though our nouriſhment be <hi>plentifull,</hi> our <hi>temper,</hi> and <hi>conſtitution</hi> is not ſo good; God hath not given it to us, as he did to them.</p>

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:114893:202"/>after <hi>stature</hi> doe.

                  <p>If we did take <hi>account</hi> of our ſtature it might be had, it is not <hi>harder</hi> in grace, nay, it is <hi>eaſier;</hi> for we cannot add a <hi>Cubit</hi> to our <hi>corporall</hi> man, but we may add <hi>more</hi> in our <hi>ſpirituall.</hi> But it is <hi>careleſſneſſe,</hi> here is the true reaſon.</p>

                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:114893:202"/>
                  <p>It is <hi>neceſſary</hi> for us to grow; neceſſary in regard of it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> and neceſſary in regard of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In regard of <hi>God,</hi> he hath given us <hi>all</hi> things that lead to <hi>perfection,</hi> and <hi>growth,</hi> he would have us walk in the practiſe of <hi>every</hi> grace, to bring forth fruit in the practiſe of <hi>every</hi> virtue, he would have us yeild <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to the Commands he gives, thoſe <hi>many</hi> Commands in the Book of God, that ſhould make us produce theſe <hi>ſeverall</hi> graces, and come to theſe ſeverall <hi>degrees.</hi> VVe had need to grow, when we look upon the <hi>work</hi> we have to doe in the VVorld, that God will call us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for, after.</p>
                  <p>Then it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> alſo, in regard of the <hi>ſtate,</hi> and <hi>pitch</hi> that God hath ſet us. Take it in it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively.</p>
                  <p>In it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> it is the ſtate of <hi>perfection,</hi> we are called to be <hi>perfect,</hi> to labour after <hi>perfection:</hi> Now <hi>how</hi> ſhould a a man labour to grow, that hath the ſtate of <hi>perfection</hi> ſet him? It is true, our <hi>perfection</hi> here is in <hi>proficiency,</hi> and acknowledging our <hi>imperfection,</hi> and <hi>advancing</hi> to perfection: But this is the <hi>greateſt</hi> perfection, becauſe this is an <hi>inducement</hi> to <hi>grow,</hi> perfection is ſet, that is <hi>far</hi> from us.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>comparatively,</hi> the ſtature that is ſet us is the ſtate of <hi>Angells,</hi> and of <hi>Heaven,</hi> we pray to doe Gods will, as the <hi>Angells,</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven. If we <hi>pray</hi> we muſt <hi>practiſe,</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> to doe it.

VVe cannot come to that <hi>pitch,</hi> yet we may in <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> though not in <hi>equallity,</hi> though not in his <hi>proportion,</hi> yet in ours, we may come to be <hi>perfect men, according to the meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt.</hi> You know what an <hi>infinite</hi> height of wiſdome there was in the ſtature of Chriſt, as <hi>man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In him is all the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wiſdome, and the treaſures of knowledge, full of grace and truth,</hi> all grace was <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi> Therefore as Chriſt had the moſt <hi>abſolute</hi> pitch and ſtature that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for <hi>Angells</hi> to conceive; ſo <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that make the <hi>myſticall</hi> ſtature of Chriſt, muſt labour to <hi>grow</hi> to a <hi>high</hi> pitch, that they may not ſeeme <hi>unworthy</hi> Members of ſo <hi>glorious,</hi> and excellent a <hi>body.</hi> It is <hi>neceſſary</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we grow, and a great deale of <hi>need,</hi> becauſe of theſe <hi>pitches</hi> that are ſet us.</p>
                  <p>Then, it is not onely a <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but an <hi>honourable</hi> thing. It is obſerved of the Ancients for <hi>corporall</hi> ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and it is a good Opinion of them, <hi>Homer</hi> alway brought in his <hi>Heroes,</hi> his <hi>worthies,</hi> he preſented them in <hi>tall,</hi> high <hi>ſtature.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:114893:203"/>was a goodly perſon.</hi> And <hi>Saul was higher then all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from the Shoulders upward.</hi> And <hi>Herodotus</hi> obſerves, that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> uſe to chooſe their <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> ſtature. And in <hi>Plutarch</hi> it is obſerved, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſet a Mulct upon one, becauſe he had married a <hi>little</hi> wife, becauſe they thought it would be a <hi>diſparagement</hi> of the <hi>Princes</hi> that ſhould be brought forth. If they had ſo good reſpect to the ſtature of the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> man, how <hi>goodly</hi> is it to be ſo <hi>ſpiritually</hi> to God. For <hi>corporall</hi> ſtature ſometimes is not <hi>an Ornament;</hi> for if the <hi>mind</hi> be not anſwerable it is rather a <hi>diſgrace;</hi> and it may be beyond thoſe <hi>proportions</hi> that are required in <hi>Decency</hi> of ſtature. But we cannot <hi>exceed</hi> in the <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> no meaſure can exceed.

Then I will ſhut up this point with the Exhortation of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> in one of his Epiſtles, that we all take care, as we grow in <hi>dayes,</hi> and <hi>yeares,</hi> ſo to grow in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, in <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>virtue,</hi> in the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of virtue that it may be ſaid of us, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that their faith <hi>did grow exceedingly, and their love one towards another abounded.</hi> That is to <hi>grow from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi>

Therefore if we ſo <hi>fit</hi> our ſelves to come into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a <hi>man</hi> that is <hi>better</hi> then our ſelves, that we may come with <hi>ſobriety,</hi> and <hi>acceptation;</hi> how ſhould we fit our ſelves to come before <hi>God,</hi> in theſe <hi>inferiour</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our <hi>appearing?</hi> It is true, we are <hi>alway</hi> preſent to <hi>him,</hi> and he to <hi>us;</hi> but his eye, though it be alwayes
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:114893:205"/>upon <hi>us, ours</hi> is not alwayes upon <hi>him;</hi> but then our eyes are <hi>directed</hi> to him, when we come into his <hi>Courts;</hi> it is called therefore <hi>appearing</hi> before God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is the illation that knits both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in thoſe two words, <hi>Every one.</hi> That is, <hi>then every one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is one word that is a word of <hi>connexion,</hi> and <hi>Then,</hi> what time? <hi>Then,</hi> when we are <hi>growne</hi> to ſtature, when we have gotten from <hi>one</hi> degree of ſtrength to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> We muſt not offer to come into Gods <hi>preſence</hi> unleſſe we bring the <hi>Wedding</hi> Garment, ſome <hi>ſtature,</hi> this cloathing of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>grace.</hi> When we come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before him, there will be an <hi>account</hi> taken of each mans ſtrength, how he hath <hi>profitted</hi> by each of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Ordinances</hi> of grace: God will look that we give <hi>account</hi> of our proficiency, by all the <hi>meanes</hi> of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When we come to the Houſe of God, and to the Table of the Lord, we ſhould bethink our ſelves, what <hi>ſtrength</hi> we bring, what <hi>ſtature</hi> we come with. Much more when we <hi>appeare</hi> before God in <hi>Heaven;</hi> there ſhall be <hi>no</hi> appearing before God in <hi>Heaven,</hi> unleſſe there there be a <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>competency.</hi> Heaven is made for the <hi>perfect. Paul</hi> dares not think of <hi>Heaven,</hi> till he have <hi>finiſhed</hi> his courſe; and Chriſt calls to God to <hi>glorifie</hi> him, when he had <hi>done</hi> his work. <hi>I have done the work that thou gaveſt me to doe, glorifie thy Son.</hi> We muſt not look to <hi>appeare</hi> before God in glory, unleſſe we goe through theſe <hi>degrees</hi> of grace, then we ſhall appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, when we are come from <hi>ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, there is a word of <hi>diſtribution,</hi> it is not <hi>all</hi> of them, but <hi>every</hi> one. The univerſall collective would have done it: <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, <hi>We ſhall all appeare before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> But it is more emphaticall, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, each</hi> man in the <hi>whole,</hi> and <hi>each</hi> one for <hi>himſelfe.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:114893:205"/>Every</hi> one comes, and <hi>appeares</hi> before God. In <hi>theſe</hi> Courts of his <hi>Houſe,</hi> though it be in a <hi>Crowd,</hi> God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <hi>every</hi> mans carriage, and <hi>proficiency:</hi> God takes ſpeciall notice when there are <hi>thouſands,</hi> as if there were but <hi>one,</hi> but all here are preſent before God. Much more when we come into his preſence of <hi>glory,</hi> then <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> one ſhall appeare, God will take <hi>account</hi> of <hi>every</hi> one, what <hi>Oyle</hi> he hath in his <hi>Lamp,</hi> what <hi>improvement</hi> he hath made of his <hi>Tallents.</hi> Then there ſhall be notice of each mans <hi>ſtate,</hi> and <hi>meaſure,</hi> of every mans <hi>height,</hi> what growth he is come to, and <hi>according</hi> to his ſtature, ſhall be his <hi>reward,</hi> and <hi>Crowne.</hi> The <hi>higher</hi> ſtature, the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> meaſure of <hi>glory;</hi> to him that hath gained <hi>five</hi> Talents ſhall be given <hi>five</hi> Citties; to him that hath gained <hi>two, two</hi> Citties; to him that hath gone through <hi>many</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and hath <hi>glorified</hi> God by an <hi>habituall</hi> practiſe of piety, there ſhall be a <hi>high</hi> reward, to them that have gone <hi>From ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> there ſhall be an addition of <hi>glory</hi> to <hi>glory.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR the ſatisfying of your expectations I have therefore made choiſe of this Text at this time; as being <hi>very</hi> agreeable, whither I look to the parts of the Auditory, or the whole, or to the time, or to what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſoever. For the <hi>lower</hi> part, <hi>Servants</hi> may learne their duty. For the <hi>upper, Maſters</hi> may have the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of theirs. And for all, your conditions are ſuch, that you are thoſe that have been held a long time
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:114893:208"/>between <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> with doubtfull news, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, and neutrall expectations. And I may well preſume it of <hi>you,</hi> becauſe I meaſure you by my <hi>ſelfe:</hi> I my ſelfe that am wavering, have beene wearied and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured both with <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> tidings, as deſirous as you to reap the <hi>comfort</hi> if they be good, or at leaſt to know the <hi>certainty</hi> if they be bad. I have for ſeverall dayes gone through Texts for both parts of the day, becauſe I was reſolved to proportion my Meditations to the times, however things fall out; but at length, finding no true ground to proceed by, no certainty in this World, of any thing almoſt, we are not certaine of our ſelves; therefore I did reſolve, and pitch upon this Scripture, that I might yet at leaſt raiſe your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a little higher, and bring you from theſe <hi>neutrall</hi> thoughts, to <hi>ſetled</hi> thoughts of Heaven; that I might bring you from theſe <hi>carnall</hi> dependencies upon man by the eare, to a ſweet, and <hi>comfortable</hi> reſting, and ſetling, and fixing, and waiting with your eyes upon God.</p>
                  <p>And that cannot be done better then by this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that I have read to you. It was penned for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry purpoſe, for the ſuſtaining of the Church in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exigents, or any great extremity. That this is the intendment of the words, appeares by the very ſcope of the Pſalme, which is nothing but this, a Pſalme of <hi>confidence</hi> for the Church of God, when ſhe ſhould be in any ſtate of <hi>affliction.</hi> And if the ſcope of the Pſalme were ſilent, yet the very time would ſpeake how it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds; it is the fourth of the fifteen that are called Pſalmes of Degrees; becauſe they were ſung upon the fifteene aſcents that were to goe to the Temple; and ſo many aſcents I have had in doubtfull expectation; it is now fifteene dayes ſince the firſt heavy tidings came to our eares, and yet we are not certaine. Therefore now
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:114893:208"/>ſince we cannot find any part of truth on <hi>Earth,</hi> let us have recourſe to <hi>Heaven,</hi> we ſhall be ſure to find them there. And the whole Book of God is nothing elſe but tidings brought from Heaven to Earth, from God to his Creature, <hi>Evangelion,</hi> the good tidings.</p>
                  <p>That was the courſe of the Saints in all exigents, ſtill to have recourſe to God by praying to him; ſo we ſhall be ſure to underſtand the end of theſe thing; if we <hi>wait</hi> upon God for the iſſue, he will ſend it in good time; if we follow the example of the Prophet <hi>David</hi> here, as good Servants, to abide his leaſure till he have mercy upon us. I ſhall handle the other clauſes (but I ſhall dwell upon the laſt) becauſe I ſhall have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to remember your of that duty, that otherwiſe I had not ſpoken of, but that the Text <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>That this is the drift at which the words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <p>There is the Covenant, in the which all Chriſtians doe enter here in the perſon of <hi>David,</hi> and that is to give God the delight of their <hi>eyes,</hi> the ſtrength of <hi>every</hi> part, the glory of that moſt excellent <hi>ſence,</hi> to be excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in that act of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Then, there is the Coppy out of which we draw this Covenant, or this duty; that is in theſe words, <hi>As the eyes of Servants looke to the hands of their Maſters, and the eyes of a Maiden upon the hands of her Miſtreſſe.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <q>Behold.</q>
                  <p>An ordinary word, but here it hath an <hi>extraordinary</hi> poſiture. Ordinarily, it is a terme of <hi>attention,</hi> uſed for the awakening of men, to ſtir up their admiration, and audience: but here it is a word not onely prefixed for the exciting of men, but of God himſelfe. <hi>David</hi> is ſpeaking to God in his Meditations. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſayth he. As we take it with reſpect to God, ſo it is a <hi>precatory</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: he beſeecheth God to look <hi>downe</hi> upon him, while he looks <hi>up</hi> unto God; look on us, as we looke to thee, <hi>Behold Lord, as the eyes of Servants, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we take it as it hath reſpect to <hi>man,</hi> ſo it is an <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary</hi> particle, to ſtir them up to doe the like. <hi>Behold,</hi> what we doe, and doe likewiſe; let <hi>your</hi> eyes be like <hi>ours. Behold, as the eyes of Servants are to the hand of their Maſters, ſo are our eyes to the Lord our God.</hi> Let yours have the ſame fixing. So it is a word that draws <hi>all</hi> eyes after it to imitation. I hope it will be a word that will draw your eares after it to attention in the ſeverall perticulars, as I ſpeake of them in order.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe, that is, the duty here ſet downe, the duty inſiſted in, the baſis of the whole, the lifting up the eyes to God. We may take it, eyther by way of declaration, as a thing that was done; or by way of Covenant, as a thing that they promiſed to doe. It is eyther a <hi>proteſtation</hi> of what they would doe, or an <hi>atteſtation</hi> of what they did. Well, couch it under both notions, it hath a double force, <hi>Our eyes are upon the Lord our God,</hi> and <hi>our eyes ſhall be upon the Lord our God.</hi> We have it expreſt in all variety in other places of the Pſalmes.</p>

If the ſoul have an intendment to lift up the <hi>heart</hi> to God, then the <hi>hands</hi> will be ready to expreſſe her <hi>affections,</hi> and the <hi>Tongue</hi> will be ready to expreſſe her <hi>notions,</hi> and the Eye will be ready to ſhare in the beatificall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Viſion;</hi> here is variety in regard of <hi>Inſtruments.</hi> So that now we may take it <hi>either</hi> way, or <hi>both</hi> wayes, when <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of lifting up his eyes, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, both of the eyes of the <hi>body,</hi> and the eyes of the <hi>mind,</hi> for the eyes of the <hi>mind,</hi> they <hi>quicken,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,</hi> the eyes of the <hi>body;</hi> and the eyes of the <hi>body,</hi> they <hi>teſtifie</hi> the devotion, and ejaculations of the <hi>mind,</hi> the one ſerves the other.</p>
                  <p>For the eyes of the body, it is their proper dutie to look up to God, God hath made them for that purpoſe, he ſet them, and gave them that poſiture, he hath ſet them in the head aloft, that they might be converſant ſtill in beholding, as <hi>Gregory Nycene</hi> ſpeaks; their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and creation that is derived from <hi>above,</hi> that with them man might behold him that gave him being, that he might look <hi>up</hi> to Heaven. There are no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures beſides, that have their eyes ſet ſo lofty as man, and man for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>For the eyes of the <hi>mind</hi> too, God hath indued the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:114893:211"/>mind with <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> and for what end? That while he is upon <hi>Earth,</hi> he ſhould know which way to have his converſe in <hi>Heaven,</hi> which cannot otherwiſe be done, but by the mind, that now while he is in the <hi>body,</hi> he might make himſelfe preſent with the <hi>Lord:</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it, but by <hi>lifting</hi> up of the heart. So it is both theſe eyes that are meant here, <hi>I lift up mine eyes to thee.</hi> And to ſhew that <hi>both</hi> are meant, the <hi>Plurall</hi> is uſed: the word is uſed foure times in theſe two Verſes, and it is <hi>Plurall</hi> in all. Once in the firſt Verſe, and thrice in this Verſe. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee I lift mine eyes,</hi> and <hi>the eyes of a Servant,</hi> and the <hi>eyes</hi> of a <hi>Hand-maid:</hi> So doe <hi>our eyes. David</hi> runs upon it <hi>oft,</hi> to point out that it ſhould be done <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> or to ſhew the diverſity of eyes that are in us. There are but <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> but there are <hi>many</hi> more of the <hi>mind.</hi> That that is ſaid of the Saints glorified, of the living Creatures, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. That they were <hi>full of eyes, before, and behind.</hi> There is good reaſon to be given of that, why they ſhould be <hi>full of eyes, before, and behind;</hi> becauſe they were to receive happineſſe in <hi>every</hi> part. Seing beatificall happineſſe conſiſts in <hi>Viſion,</hi> they muſt be all <hi>eye,</hi> that they may be all <hi>bleſſed,</hi> that they may be <hi>full</hi> of viſion, they are full of eyes, <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>behind;</hi> there is good reaſon that the <hi>glorified</hi> Saints ſhould be full of eyes. And there is good reaſon that the Saints <hi>millitant</hi> ſhould be full of eyes too: The eyes that they have, have both poſitures, to look <hi>back</hi> to the promiſes fullfilled, and to look <hi>forward</hi> to the promiſes that are to be fulfilled; and to look <hi>downe</hi> upon Earth, but not except it be to the contempt of it, and to look <hi>up</hi> to Heaven with a <hi>deſire</hi> after it, they have eyes <hi>within,</hi> and eyes <hi>without,</hi> that both may be directed to God. They are <hi>full</hi> of eyes. There is the eye of <hi>devotion,</hi> that is lift up in Prayer. <hi>In the morning will I direct my Prayer to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:114893:211"/>thee, and will looke up.</hi> Where ever there is <hi>Prayer,</hi> there is looking <hi>up.</hi> Prayer is the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> that we ſend up, and the eye is a ſecond <hi>Meſſenger</hi> that we ſend after it, for Conduct; the eye carries the <hi>Candle</hi> to our Prayers, to lead them the way to Heaven, it goes before them, to <hi>point</hi> them the way, there is the eye of Devotion in Prayer, and there is the eye of <hi>contemplation,</hi> that is lift up in <hi>meditation,</hi> and the eye of <hi>faith</hi> that is lift up to God in <hi>trust,</hi> and beleiving. There is the eye of <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> in <hi>hope,</hi> and the eye of <hi>attendance</hi> in giving <hi>obedience</hi> to God. Look how many heavenly duties there are, ſo many <hi>eyes</hi> there are. Becauſe there is no duty or work can be done without the light of the <hi>eye,</hi> it is that that is the <hi>Guide,</hi> and light. So now, the ſumm of all is this, that it is a ſpeciall act of Religion to <hi>lift</hi> up our <hi>eyes</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> It is an act of <hi>Religion,</hi> not onely for the <hi>mind,</hi> but to lift up the eyes of the <hi>body.</hi> It ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be an act of <hi>Religion,</hi> eaſily, an act of <hi>piety</hi> by the <hi>contrary.</hi> The Scripture uſeth the other, the contrary, as an act of <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. God blames them there and threatens them, becauſe they <hi>lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> up their <hi>eyes</hi> to the <hi>Idolls</hi> of the Houſe of Iſrael, they lift up their eyes, that is, they <hi>Worſhipped</hi> them; it was an act of Religion, it was <hi>religious</hi> worſhip they gave them, when they lifted up their eyes. When we lift up our <hi>eyes</hi> to God, it is an Act of <hi>piety,</hi> it is ſo, and we muſt make it ſo. There is good reaſon why we ſhould make it ſo. We owe God the ſtrength of our <hi>bodies,</hi> as well as of our <hi>ſouls.</hi> He that ſayth, we ſhall worſhip God withall our <hi>ſoule,</hi> ſaith we ſhall worſhip God with all our <hi>ſtrength.</hi> If we owe God the ſtrength of our <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> we owe him no part more then the <hi>eye.</hi> The <hi>eyes</hi> are the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> thoſe <hi>Lamps</hi> have more of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> then any part of the body, there is no part of the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:114893:212"/>body that pertakes ſo much of <hi>Heaven,</hi> as the eye. There is no part that God beſtowed ſo much <hi>coſt</hi> on in the creation, as on the <hi>eye.</hi> Therefore the ſtrength of the eye muſt returne upon him, the curioſity of the <hi>eye</hi> is ſuch, that all the <hi>Jewells,</hi> and precious ſtones in the World, are not able to match the excellency of the <hi>eye.</hi> The next reaſon is, becauſe when the ſoule is lifted up, if the <hi>eye</hi> goe with it, it makes a <hi>perfect</hi> Elevation. There is the <hi>ſoule</hi> for all <hi>within,</hi> and the <hi>eye</hi> carries all <hi>without,</hi> there is a perfect elevation of the whole man.</p>
                  <p>Then the third reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>ſoule</hi> cannot be lifted up without the <hi>eye;</hi> for there is no part that the ſoul ſhews it ſelfe ſo much in, as in the <hi>eye.</hi> What ever the affection of the <hi>heart</hi> be, it will appeare in the <hi>eye.</hi> If it be <hi>ſorrow,</hi> it will appeare in the eye, the eye will be <hi>dejected.</hi> If it be anger, the eye will <hi>ſparkle.</hi> If it be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> the eye will be <hi>lift</hi> up. It is the very <hi>beames,</hi> the ſtrength of the beames of the eye, when they are enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>faith,</hi> that pierce <hi>Heaven,</hi> as well as our <hi>words</hi> pierce Heaven with <hi>ejaculations.</hi> God reads the very <hi>notions,</hi> and thoughts of our <hi>hearts,</hi> in our <hi>eyes:</hi> though he <hi>need</hi> not theſe wayes to know them, for he reads them in the <hi>heart</hi> it ſelfe, but when the eye teſtifies them, it is a teſtimony of that we <hi>think,</hi> given by our <hi>eye.</hi> There are many teſtimonies in the lifting up the eyes to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a teſtimony of a <hi>beleiving,</hi> humble heart. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity</hi> will never carry a man above the <hi>Earth. Pride</hi> can carry a man no higher then the <hi>Earth</hi> neither. The <hi>proud</hi> man looks aloft, his eyes are high, yet they are <hi>below,</hi> they are upon the <hi>Earth</hi> ſtill; the <hi>loftineſſe</hi> is the <hi>lowneſſe;</hi> there is nothing lower then <hi>pride.</hi> The <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> mans eye is <hi>aloft,</hi> though it be <hi>below,</hi> and the <hi>proud</hi> mans eye is <hi>low,</hi> though it be <hi>aloft; infidelity,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi>
                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:114893:212"/>will not carry above the Earth; but <hi>faith</hi> carries to <hi>Heaven,</hi> to the Throne of God, and looks on him as a <hi>helper,</hi> as a <hi>rewarder,</hi> and a <hi>Judge.</hi> It is a teſtimony of a <hi>beleiving</hi> heart.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>lifting</hi> up of the eye, it is a teſtimony of an <hi>obedient</hi> heart. A man that <hi>lifts</hi> up his eye to God, he acknowledgeth thus much, Lord, I am thy <hi>Servant,</hi> he acknowledgeth that he hath <hi>all</hi> from him, his <hi>body,</hi> and his <hi>ſoule;</hi> his <hi>body</hi> is not his <hi>owne,</hi> his <hi>eyes</hi> are not his <hi>owne,</hi> but for <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice; he acknowledgeth that he will dedicate to God both <hi>ſoule,</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> that he will ſubject both to his will, and appointment. It is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of an <hi>obedient</hi> heart.</p>
                  <p>And it is a teſtimony thirdly, of a <hi>thankfull</hi> heart. A man that lifts up his eyes to Heaven, acknowledgeth that he receives <hi>every</hi> good bleſſing, every <hi>perfect gift from above,</hi> that he receives <hi>all</hi> from the hand of <hi>God.</hi> It is a teſtimony of a thankfull heart.</p>
                  <p>Then, it is a teſtimony of a <hi>Heavenly</hi> heart, he that <hi>lifts</hi> up his eyes to Heaven, acknowledgeth that he is <hi>weary</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> his <hi>heart</hi> is not there, his <hi>hope,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is <hi>above.</hi> A man will caſt his <hi>eye</hi> where his <hi>wiſhes</hi> are; he will oft caſt his <hi>eyes</hi> where his <hi>heart</hi> is. Either we are all <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> or our hearts are in <hi>Heaven.</hi> If we conſtantly lift our <hi>eyes</hi> to Heaven, and have our <hi>hearts</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> we play the egregious Hypocrites with God. If we lift our eyes up to Heaven, and our <hi>hearts</hi> are not there, judge what you doe. God looks upon that <hi>heart,</hi> that ſends up thoſe <hi>eyes,</hi> and ſees whither the <hi>heart</hi> be there; for the lifting up of the eyes, is a teſtimony of a <hi>Heavenly</hi> heart. If we lift not up the heart when we lift up the eye, we tell a <hi>lye</hi> to God with our <hi>eyes.</hi> It is a teſtimony of a heavenly heart.</p>
                  <p>It is a teſtimony of a <hi>devout</hi> heart, there is <hi>no</hi> part of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:114893:213"/>the body beſides the <hi>Tongue</hi> that is ſo great an Agent in Prayer, as the <hi>eye.</hi> The Tongue is the greateſt in <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> prayer, but the <hi>eye</hi> muſt be <hi>next</hi> the Tongue, nay in one thing <hi>above</hi> the Tongue; for in Prayer the <hi>eye</hi> is the <hi>Interpreter</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> together with the <hi>Tongue.</hi> Nay, and further, it is not onely the hearts <hi>Interpreter,</hi> but the hearts <hi>intelligencer,</hi> which the Tongue is not; for as a man takes order for his <hi>way,</hi> he ſpies, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes what he can <hi>diſcover,</hi> if there be any <hi>danger;</hi> the eye is the light of all the body: So a man that humbles himſelfe in <hi>Prayer,</hi> he lifts up his eyes to <hi>Heaven,</hi> he looks and ſpies whence <hi>Salvation</hi> comes, where he ſhall have <hi>help,</hi> and whence he receives <hi>comfort;</hi> the ſoul looks up, and the eye ſpies out in what diſtreſſe ſoever we are: If we be <hi>diſconſolate,</hi> the eye looks up for <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> If we be in <hi>perſecution,</hi> the eye looks about for <hi>reſt:</hi> If we be <hi>burthened,</hi> the eye looks for <hi>eaſe;</hi> if we be in <hi>want,</hi> the eye looks for <hi>ſupply,</hi> in every affliction, the eye ſpies out the comfort for all; the eye is the ſouls <hi>Intelligencer,</hi> therefore the lifting up of the eyes is the argument of a <hi>devout</hi> heart. Becauſe all theſe good things come from <hi>above,</hi> from God, therefore the <hi>ſoule</hi> is lifted up, and whenſoever the <hi>ſoule</hi> goes to be lifted up, the <hi>eye</hi> as a good Servant waits on it, it never goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we muſt labour, and exerciſe our ſelves to give God the glory of our <hi>eyes,</hi> as well as the glory of our <hi>Lips,</hi> and then we give him the glory of our <hi>eyes,</hi> when we <hi>lift up</hi> our eyes, and lift up <hi>ſuch</hi> eyes as God requires. What eyes are thoſe?</p>
                  <p>Let us take heed <hi>what</hi> eyes we lift up. There are <hi>adulterous</hi> eyes, there are <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>haughty</hi> eyes, take heed of bringing theſe to God, <hi>cloſe</hi> them, cloſe them rather, <hi>wink</hi> when you come to God, open not thoſe eyes.</p>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:114893:213"/>
                  <p>Firſt, therefore bring eyes that are <hi>chaſt,</hi> they are <hi>Doves</hi> eyes that muſt look up to that God of purity. Then, they muſt be <hi>humble</hi> eyes that muſt look to that Throne of <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> they muſt not be eyes that are <hi>faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,</hi> and <hi>luſtfull.</hi> Then, they muſt be <hi>innocent</hi> eyes, not <hi>bloud-ſhot,</hi> not <hi>revengefull</hi> eyes, that muſt look up to that God of <hi>mercy,</hi> and goodneſſe. O how <hi>pure</hi> had a man need to make his eyes, that will look up to <hi>God?</hi> How pure ſhould his heart be, and his eyes be? He muſt be purified in <hi>every</hi> part. The <hi>eye</hi> is the <hi>pureſt</hi> part.</p>
                  <p>If a man doe but look upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> he cannot look with his <hi>owne</hi> eyes, but he muſt borrow eyes of <hi>others,</hi> both pure, and ſtrong eyes. Now the eyes of the <hi>mind</hi> are the <hi>ſtrongeſt,</hi> if the heart be kept <hi>innocent,</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> and in <hi>purity,</hi> let us bring theſe eyes to God, look up to him with theſe eyes.</p>
                  <p>I muſt cut off my ſelfe in my Meditations, the time runs on with ſwifter Wings then Speech.</p>
                  <p>I goe to the next poynt. Thus much of the <hi>duty,</hi> that is, the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the whole. Now the other is more ſpeciall, the ſecond is the <hi>patterne,</hi> the <hi>Coppy</hi> that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to himſelfe to write by.</p>
                  <q>As the eyes of Servants looke to the hands of their Maſters, and the eyes of a Maiden to the hands of her Miſtris.</q>
                  <p>There is the <hi>Coppy,</hi> it is ſet downe with the beſt <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> if we conſider the perſons here meant. There are three things obſervable in the forme of Penning this part.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is not ſaid, ſimply, as <hi>Servants</hi> look to their <hi>Maſters,</hi> and a <hi>Maiden</hi> to her <hi>miſtreſſe,</hi> but <hi>as the eyes of Servants are towards their Masters, and the eyes of a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:114893:214"/>to her Miſtreſſe.</hi> What is the reaſon of this phraſe? There is good reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe there is a Service that is to be done to thoſe <hi>Maſters</hi> that are ſet over us below, even with the <hi>eye. Not with eye-ſervice,</hi> that is, not with eye-ſervice <hi>alone,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. But there is a ſervice that is to be done with the <hi>eye.</hi> A man may ſhew <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance,</hi> and reverence with his <hi>eye;</hi> a man may give a ſhrewd, <hi>untoward</hi> anſwer with his <hi>eye,</hi> as well as with his <hi>Tongue.</hi> A Servant may teſtifie his <hi>chearfull,</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> attendance on his Maſter, with his <hi>eye;</hi> if there be <hi>obedience,</hi> it will appeare in the <hi>eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, it ſhould be ſo <hi>generall</hi> a reſpect, and good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour that Servants ſhould carry towards their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that even their <hi>eyes</hi> ſhould teſtifie it; their <hi>eyes</hi> ſhould be acquainted with their Maſters will, as <hi>Plau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us</hi> ſpeaks well, a <hi>good</hi> Servant is ſo acquainted with his Maſters affairs, that his very <hi>eye</hi> knowes what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would have; you may read it in his <hi>fore-head,</hi> though his Maſter <hi>ſpeak</hi> not. And look as it is with Maſters, it is <hi>Hillaries</hi> Obſervation. A Maſter may give <hi>Commands</hi> as well with his <hi>eye,</hi> as with his <hi>voyce, Non ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ore, &amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Maſter</hi> will Command not onely with his <hi>voyce,</hi> but with his <hi>hand,</hi> and with his <hi>eye:</hi> ſo a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> may <hi>obey,</hi> and expreſſe his behaviour, and reſpect, and carriage toward his Maſter, he may teſtifie his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, not onely in <hi>action,</hi> or Speech, or Tongue, but with his very <hi>eye, Non ore, &amp;c.</hi> he <hi>eyes,</hi> and obeys with his <hi>eye,</hi> as well as with his <hi>voyce.</hi> Therefore it is, <hi>As the eyes of Servants are towards their Maſters.</hi> The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is ſo carefull to content his Maſter, that he will not offend him ſo much as with his <hi>eye.</hi> There is the firſt Obſervation for the phraſe. It is not ſimply ſaid, as <hi>Servants,</hi> but the <hi>eyes</hi> of Servants.</p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:114893:214"/>
                  <p>Secondly, it is not ſaid ſimply, as the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>Servants</hi> are towards their <hi>Maſters,</hi> but <hi>as the eyes of Servants are towards the hands of their Maſters, and the eyes of a Maiden to the hands of her Miſtreſſe.</hi> Why is this word added? Was it not enough to ſay as the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>Servants</hi> are to their <hi>Maſters?</hi> Why to the <hi>hands</hi> of their Maſters, and to the <hi>hands</hi> of her Miſtreſſe?</p>
                  <p>Yes, for very good reaſon. Firſt, it is ſaid to the <hi>hands</hi> of their Maſters, and the <hi>hands</hi> of her Miſtreſſe, as a teſtimony of their <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> and ſubjection; becauſe it is the <hi>hand</hi> by which they <hi>governe,</hi> it is the hand by which they <hi>correct,</hi> therefore ſtill the Servant keeps his eye upon the <hi>hand</hi> of his Maſter. As <hi>Plantus</hi> ſayth well, it is by the <hi>hand</hi> that the Maſter orders, and <hi>governes,</hi> therefore the Servant hath his eye upon his <hi>hand.</hi> It is a teſtimony of all <hi>reverence,</hi> and a teſtimony of <hi>ſubjection,</hi> and ſubmiſſion, and humiliation. A dutifull Servant dares not preſume to look his Maſter in the <hi>face,</hi> he keeps his eye onely upon his <hi>hands</hi> below.</p>
                  <p>Then, it is a teſtimony of his <hi>hope,</hi> it is a bountifull <hi>hand</hi> that the Maſter rewards with, he keeps his eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>hands,</hi> thence he receives his <hi>reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, it is a teſtimony of his <hi>obedience,</hi> he looks to his <hi>hands;</hi> he looks not that his Maſter ſhould <hi>ſpeake</hi> to him alway; if it be but the <hi>pointing</hi> of the <hi>finger,</hi> but the wagging of the <hi>hand,</hi> if he know his Maſters will he accounts that a <hi>Command.</hi> A Servant muſt not alway ſtay ſo long till his Maſter give him a <hi>Command,</hi> but <hi>any</hi> expreſſion of his Maſter will ſerve the turne, it ſtands for a Command, for an <hi>injunction.</hi> Therefore it is well obſerved by one of the Heathens, and by another, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and forward, that as <hi>Maſters</hi> ſhould be to their Servants, ſo <hi>Servants</hi> to their Maſters. The S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:114893:215"/>Servants, as <hi>Monoſillables.</hi> What meant he by it. That if he be a good Servant he ſhould not need to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſwaſions, and entreaties, but he ſhould be as a <hi>Monoſillable,</hi> one word ſhould be enough. See it in higher matters, that God might ſhew himſelfe <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> the ſupreame Maſter, though he gave ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his will in larger Commands, yet he gives the reſt in a Monoſillable <hi>Love,</hi> it is the <hi>whole</hi> duty of a Chriſtian; we muſt be as <hi>Monoſillables</hi> eſpecially to God. The Centurion ſaid to his Servants, to one <hi>goe,</hi> and to another <hi>come,</hi> both Monoſillables in our Language. The <hi>Maſter</hi> ſhould be a Monoſillable to the Servant, and the <hi>Servant</hi> to the Maſter. One <hi>ſillable</hi> is enough to a good Servant, nay, a <hi>nod,</hi> or an <hi>accent</hi> is enough; if it be but the <hi>beckning</hi> of the hand. To ſhew, that a good Servant is of a docible diſpoſition, and <hi>tractable,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, he looks to the hands of his Maſter, to ſhew that he is <hi>ready,</hi> he is at hand, he is at his <hi>Elbow;</hi> it is his <hi>joy,</hi> and delight, and glory, that he may doe with <hi>chearfullneſſe,</hi> his Maſters will, therefore they look to the <hi>hands</hi> of their Maſters, for all theſe reaſons it is ſaid to the <hi>hands.</hi> That is the ſecond expreſſion, the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>Servants</hi> to the <hi>hands</hi> of their <hi>Maſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third place, it is not barely ſaid, <hi>As the eyes of Servants are to the hands of their Maſters,</hi> but it is added, <hi>As the eyes of a Hand-maid are to her Miſtreſſe.</hi> Here is mention of both <hi>Sexes,</hi> and both <hi>Governours, Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Miſtreſſe, Servants,</hi> and <hi>Hand-maid.</hi> What ſhould be the reaſon? To take away all ſcruples, and to remove all doubts.</p>
                  <p>The one to ſhew this, that there is <hi>obedience,</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and reſpect, and obſervance, and reverence due to <hi>all</hi> kind of <hi>Maſters,</hi> from <hi>Servants,</hi> whither of <hi>ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> or of <hi>inferiour</hi> Servants. Apprentices think they
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:114893:215"/>may <hi>contemne,</hi> and deſpiſe their Maſters if they be <hi>poore</hi> men. No, if they be ſet in that relation, they are their Governours, and of what ſort or quality ſoever they be, there is reſpect to be given to them. Look as it is in the other relation of <hi>Parentage;</hi> the Scripture is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not onely to preſerve the honour of the <hi>Father,</hi> but becauſe the <hi>Mother</hi> is more ſubject to be <hi>contemned,</hi> and deſpiſed, therefore it takes care to preſerve the honour of the <hi>Mother,</hi> of the <hi>weaker</hi> Sex, therefore <hi>twiſe</hi> for once of honour to the <hi>Father,</hi> we read of honour to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And as it takes order to give reſpect to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> ſo to the <hi>Miſtreſſe,</hi> they muſt have reſpect, let them be of what <hi>ſex,</hi> or ſtate, and <hi>condition</hi> ſoever, that are ſet over you.</p>
                  <p>Then, the other is doubled, <hi>Servant,</hi> and <hi>Hand-maid,</hi> to ſhew, that it is the duty of <hi>all</hi> Servants to doe this, of whar <hi>ſex,</hi> or <hi>age</hi> ſoever, whether they be thoſe that are <hi>bound,</hi> or <hi>hixed,</hi> whether they be <hi>old,</hi> or <hi>young,</hi> their eyes muſt be towards their Maſters, not onely their <hi>eyes,</hi> but their <hi>hearts, Not with eye-ſervice,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayth. <hi>Pleaſing men, but for conſcience ſerving the Lord.</hi> See, it is a point of <hi>Conſcience</hi> for <hi>Servants</hi> to be <hi>dutifull</hi> to their <hi>Maſters.</hi> I am glad I have the point in hand, I have oft deſir'd to have an opportunity. It is <hi>your</hi> Scripture now, I pray think of it, you that are in that condition. It is a point of <hi>Conſcience</hi> for Servants to give reſpect to their <hi>Maſters,</hi> in ſerving <hi>them,</hi> they ſerve the <hi>Lord, as Serving the Lord,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>not with eye-ſervice,</hi> but with the ſervice of the <hi>heart,</hi> they muſt ſerve them with the <hi>heart,</hi> as well as with the <hi>eye,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> muſt not entertaine a hard <hi>ſurmiſe,</hi> or make an <hi>ill</hi> conſtruction, they muſt not think <hi>evill</hi> of their Maſters. They ſerve the Lord.</p>
                  <p>There is very good reaſon for it, becauſe <hi>Servants</hi>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:114893:216"/>they are not their <hi>

                  <p>Take notice of it, becauſe this piece of the <hi>Aeconomicall</hi> body is wholly out of frame, every man almoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, and there is juſt cauſe. It is a very <hi>rare,</hi> and hard thing to find a conſcionable <hi>Servant.</hi> Servants have gotten now the <hi>Reines</hi> on their <hi>owne</hi> necks, they have caſt off the yoake. There is no man that hath a <hi>Servant,</hi> but he muſt look to have <hi>halfe</hi> a Maſter.

                  <p>I know not how it comes to paſſe, but it is a thing complained of by <hi>all,</hi> there is no <hi>great</hi> Houſe eſpecially,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:114893:216"/>nor indeed no <hi>little</hi> Houſe, but if they have any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they are thoſe that are <hi>untoward,</hi> there are very few <hi>good</hi> Servants. A <hi>good</hi> Servant is a great <hi>Jewell,</hi> not onely becauſe he is <hi>uſefull,</hi> but becauſe he is <hi>rare,</hi> and their <hi>Religion</hi> is like their <hi>ſtate,</hi> there are few of them <hi>conſcionable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether it be ſo that the fault be in your <hi>ſelves,</hi> or no, (it ſhould be your duty to look whether it be ſo or no) that ſome of you when you were <hi>Servants,</hi> were ſuch to <hi>your</hi> Maſters, and God payes you in your <hi>kind.</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuch <hi>Children</hi> as we are, ſuch <hi>Parents</hi> we prove; he that hath beene an <hi>unfaithfull Child,</hi> ſhall have <hi>unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> Children; he that hath beene an unfaithfull <hi>Servant,</hi> ſhall have <hi>ſuch</hi> Servants. Or whether you be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>Teach</hi> them better, you inſtruct them in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of your Trades that they may ſerve <hi>you,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver care to inſtruct them in the feare of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that they may ſerve the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſerve <hi>God,</hi> and ſuch comfort, and <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> you have; becauſe you would have them onely ſerve <hi>you,</hi> and not <hi>God,</hi> God orders it ſo, that they ſhall not be ſerviceable to <hi>you,</hi> he puniſheth you. That may be another reaſon, you <hi>neglect</hi> them. Or whether they get theſe ill conditions by your <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as indeed it falls out generally, ſo that <hi>Servants</hi> have a <hi>tang</hi> of the qualities, and <hi>conditions</hi> of their <hi>Maſters.

                  <p>Give me leave Brethren to ſpeake to you that are in that <hi>inferiour</hi> condition; it becomes you to <hi>redeeme</hi> this imputation that lies on your ſtate, and <hi>condition,</hi> it is a <hi>good</hi> ſtate in it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> but you make it <hi>ill</hi> by your <hi>carriage.</hi> Remember with your ſelves, that though you be <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> yet you are <hi>Free-men</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> he that is <hi>mans Servant,</hi> is the <hi>Lords Free-man,</hi> if he give conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice, ſerving <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Master.</hi> Remember God will call you to account for the <hi>ſervice</hi> you have done to your <hi>Maſters,</hi> as well as of that you doe to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> and of the <hi>neglect</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> as well as of <hi>himſelfe.</hi> Remember how bountifully God rewarded <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they were Servants. Remember how he thought on the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> in a ſtrang Land. Remember how <hi>Christ</hi> honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that condition (I ſpeake that it is much for your honour) Chriſt honoured it, <hi>He tooke upon him the forme of a Servant.</hi> Here is an honour done to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove your <hi>Maſters;</hi> though he were <hi>Lord of all,</hi> yet here was the manifeſtation of his humiliation, he <hi>tooke the forme of a Servant:</hi> that if we account it an honour to our nature above Angells, that Chriſt tooke <hi>humane</hi> nature, and not <hi>angelicall,</hi> as indeed it was an honour, then it was an honour done to <hi>Servants,</hi> that Chriſt would ſtoop ſo low to take upon him the forme of a <hi>Servant.</hi> Whatſoever <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>ſtate</hi> Chriſt took he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured it, he honoured the <hi>Manger,</hi> that he made it his <hi>Cradle;</hi> and he honoured the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> by that death that he was pleaſed to ſuffer, and he honoured the <hi>Grave</hi> by deſcending into it, and he honoured our <hi>nature</hi> in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, and he hath honoured your <hi>condition,</hi> he took on him the <hi>forme of a Servant.</hi>

                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:114893:217"/>
                  <p>Learne to anſwer that honour, it is not an <hi>unworthy</hi> condition; labour to bring <hi>honour</hi> to your eſtate, to bring honour to <hi>God</hi> in your ſervice, to bring credite to your <hi>Religion,</hi> and profeſſion, to be <hi>better</hi> then your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> (if they goe not along with you to Heaven) to be Children of <hi>God,</hi> to be <hi>rich</hi> in grace, to be <hi>precious</hi> to him; to give your Maſters <hi>faithfull</hi> ſervice for <hi>conſcience</hi> ſake. Remember theſe things, and ſtir up your ſelves to attaine to the purity of former times, to have the <hi>Circum volution</hi> to anſwer them. What was the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Servants</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> time? What Servants were they? You may learne by this Scripture; <hi>David</hi> takes it for granted, he ſpeaks of it as a thing to be preſumed on, that Servants were <hi>good</hi> then. Unleſſe he had knowne them to be good, he would not have borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> no more would I, we then would ſay, as Servants <hi>ſhould</hi> be to their Maſters, and not as they <hi>are.</hi> You muſt labour to make the times as they have been, that we may fetch the ſimilitude from you, to ſay, <hi>As the eyes of Servants are to the hands of their Maſters.</hi> That is the ſecond thing, the Coppie. I am loath to breake off in the middeſt, the end why I choſe the Text was for the laſt part of the words, but now it will even ſerve for another Sermon. There will be the duty of you that are <hi>Maſters,</hi> and it wil be your ſhame more then of your <hi>Servants,</hi> that you doe not ſerve <hi>God,</hi> and there will be <hi>directions</hi> in all <hi>doubtings,</hi> and expectations to <hi>waite</hi> on God <hi>till he have mercy upon us.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a Scripture you ſee that runs upon <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and life of a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is in <hi>conformity,</hi> and <hi>proportion;</hi> and in things that are proportionable, there are in the generall but two things to be conſidered; there is the skene, or <hi>tipe;</hi> and there is the <hi>draught</hi> that anſwers it. Theſe are as two lines that run along one by another, and are meaſured out by the ſame quallity of dimenſion, for <hi>length,</hi> and for whatſoever elſe may make them confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable. And theſe two lines they are very obſervable now in this Text. There is the firſt the line <hi>from</hi> which the ſimilitude is drawne, that is the <hi>exemplary</hi> line, in the firſt halfe of the words, <hi>Behold, as the eyes of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:114893:219"/>looke to the hands of their Maſters, and the eyes of a Maiden to the hands of her Miſtreſſe;</hi> that is the line <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary,</hi> whence the ſimilitude is drawne; that is the <hi>Protaſis,</hi> that is the line of <hi>preſcription,</hi> that is the line <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulative,</hi> the line that gives law to this other line that followes. That is now the line that is <hi>conformable,</hi> the line that makes the proportion to the other line, the line that hath the ſimilitude, and <hi>Image</hi> of the other ſtamped on it; that is it which is the redition, the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podeſis,</hi> that which <hi>anſwers</hi> the former line in every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, in every part.</p>
                  <q>So doe our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, untill he have mercy upon us.</q>
                  <p>So here, <hi>face anſwereth face,</hi> and <hi>bone</hi> anſwereth <hi>bone.</hi> There is mention of <hi>Maſters,</hi> and <hi>ſuperiors</hi> in the firſt; of a <hi>Heavenly</hi> Maſter in the ſecond. There is mention of <hi>Servants</hi> in the firſt; of the Servants of <hi>God</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; of <hi>looking</hi> up in the firſt, of <hi>waiting</hi> in the ſecond; of eyes <hi>corporall</hi> in the firſt, of eyes <hi>ſpirituall</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Onely this line <hi>exceeds</hi> the other, in this one proportion, it is drawne a little <hi>longer</hi> then the former: becauſe Gods mercies are of an infinite longitude, there is nothing able to paralell them, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill he have mercy upon us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the firſt of theſe I ſpake in the Fore-noone, and it was but <hi>halfe</hi> the Journey I meant then to have taken. I ſhall now ſpeake to the ſecond part, the proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>redition;</hi> it is the writing that matcheth the <hi>Coppie</hi> that was ſet in the former words. If I had handled it then, it would have been but halfe an houre, I ſhall now lengthen it to the full, and truſt your memories with that I delivered. The ſum was but theſe two things.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:114893:219"/>The duty of Chriſtians, to know that they muſt dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to God, as the <hi>faculties</hi> of their <hi>mind,</hi> ſo the <hi>parts</hi> of their <hi>bodies,</hi> their <hi>Tongue,</hi> that is their <hi>glory,</hi> and their <hi>eyes,</hi> thoſe are their <hi>Lamps,</hi> and the light of their bodies; and thoſe are their <hi>perfections,</hi> if they ſhine in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, by looking up to him. That was the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the duty that concernes you that are of the <hi>lower</hi> ſort, thoſe that are in the condition of <hi>Servants,</hi> of what <hi>ſex</hi> ſoever, that it is a <hi>conſcionable</hi> performance that God expects at the hands of Servants, to give <hi>faithfull,</hi> and conſtant <hi>obedience,</hi> and conformity in all things, in a ſubmiſſion, and ſubordination to God, in all things, to the will, and inclination, and direction, of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. So, here is the <hi>Coppie</hi> ſet, and that is a good draught that muſt <hi>exceed</hi> it; and that muſt be the labour of us that are to ſpeak, and heare of it; and I will come di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to it, and there are but theſe two parts of it, which are two of the foure which I mentioned in the Fore-noone.</p>
                  <p>There is the <hi>paralell</hi> that anſwers the Coppie before. <hi>So doe our eyes waite on the Lord our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Date,</hi> and <hi>Duration</hi> of this duty, how long it is to be continued, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill he have mercy on us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, theſe are the two things that now I am to ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt of theſe is the <hi>Paralell</hi> that matcheth the Coppie, the proficiency that Chriſtians make by the documents they have from theſe temporall relations; and it is ſet downe here by a great deale of advantage, there is never a word but hath its <hi>emphaſis,</hi> and there is never a word but will require a reaſon to be given of it, why it ſtands in this place.</p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:114893:220"/>
                  <p>Why our <hi>Eyes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why <hi>Waiting?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why upon the <hi>Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why another name of excellency is added, <hi>The Lord our God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is the extent of this <hi>So? So our eyes waite,</hi> which is the proportionable part. I ſay there are reaſons to be given of all theſe, and inſtructions that will ariſe out of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, why he mentions <hi>eyes, ſo our eyes waite?</hi> For he might have varied it, ſo our <hi>ſouls</hi> wait, which is the chiefe ſcope, and intention of the Pſalmiſt. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had mentioned the <hi>eyes</hi> of Servants before, he mentions the eyes of Chriſtians, the Servants of God now, <hi>So our eyes waite.</hi> It ſhews us thus much, that our <hi>eye</hi> is the Hand-maid of the ſoule, that is exerciſed in all thoſe duties of piety, in which the ſoul is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.

                  <p>The eye <hi>waiting,</hi> the reaſon of the ſecond word. Now he leaves the ſimilitude, the firſt line; for in the firſt line it is ſo, <hi>as the eyes of Servants looke,</hi> and the <hi>eyes of a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den looke,</hi> here it is the eye <hi>waits.</hi> There is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to <hi>wait</hi> is more then to <hi>looke,</hi> to <hi>wait</hi> is to look <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,</hi> with <hi>patience,</hi> and ſubmiſſion, by ſubjecting <hi>our</hi> affections, and wills, and deſires to <hi>Gods</hi> will, that is to <hi>wait. David</hi> in the ſecond part, in the ſecond line, he gives a <hi>better</hi> word, he betters his Coppie. There is the duty of a Chriſtian, to <hi>better</hi> his example, the eyes of Servants <hi>look, Davids</hi> eyes ſhall <hi>waite, So doe our eyes wait.</hi> It is true indeed, this word is not in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, therefore you may obſerve it is in a <hi>ſmall</hi> letter in your Bibles, to note, that it is a word of neceſſity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:114893:221"/>for the ſupply of the ſence, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt left it not <hi>imperfect,</hi> but more perfect, that he put not in the <hi>Verb,</hi> becauſe it is left to every mans heart, to ſupply a Verb to his owne <hi>comfort,</hi> and a better he cannot then this. And that this word muſt be added, appeares by the next words. <hi>Till he have mercy upon us.</hi> To <hi>looke</hi> till he have mercy on us, is to <hi>wait;</hi> ſo there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why this word is added. If we look to the <hi>thing</hi> begged <hi>mercy,</hi> it is ſo <hi>precious</hi> that we may <hi>wait</hi> for it. It was <hi>Servants</hi> that he mentioned, and it is their duty to <hi>wait</hi> upon their Maſters, they <hi>wait</hi> upon their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers at <hi>meat,</hi> they wait when they goe to <hi>bed,</hi> and when they <hi>riſe,</hi> they wait in <hi>every</hi> place; therefore becauſe he had mentioned the firſt word, he takes the proper duty, there is nothing more proper to <hi>Servants,</hi> then <hi>waiting,</hi> and if we are the Servants of God, we muſt wait. There is good reaſon in that reſpect, becauſe it is a word ſo ſignificant, therefore the Spirit of God varies it, he keeps not exactly to the line, ſo doe our eyes <hi>looke,</hi> but, ſo doe our eyes <hi>wait.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, why he makes another variation, ſo doe our eyes wait upon the <hi>Lord?</hi> He writes not after his Coppie, for there it is, <hi>As the eyes of Servants looke to the hands of their Maſters.</hi> It ſhould have run, <hi>So</hi> doe our eyes wait on the <hi>hand</hi> of the Lord; he ſayth not ſo, but varies it, <hi>So doe our eyes wait on the Lord.</hi> What is the reaſon? It would have been too <hi>ſtrait.</hi> Though we muſt wait on Gods gracious <hi>hand,</hi> both of <hi>power,</hi> that orders all things, and of <hi>bounty,</hi> that diſtributes all things; yet it would have been <hi>too</hi> ſtrait; ſome would have imagined that there were <hi>nothing</hi> in God to be <hi>wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> on, but for his <hi>bounty,</hi> and <hi>power;</hi> No, he ſhews that we muſt at large wait upon the Lord in <hi>all</hi> that belongs to him, if we have reſpect to his <hi>glory,</hi> and honour, we
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:114893:221"/>muſt wait upon his <hi>Throne,</hi> if to our <hi>vileneſſe,</hi> we muſt waite on his <hi>Footeſtoole.</hi> If to his <hi>bounty,</hi> we muſt wait on his <hi>hand:</hi> if to his <hi>wiſdome,</hi> we muſt wait upon his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> if to his <hi>truth,</hi> we muſt wait on his <hi>promiſes.</hi> There is <hi>nothing</hi> in God, but it is to be <hi>waited</hi> on, in all his attributes, and relations, not onely as our <hi>Maſter,</hi> but as our <hi>King,</hi> as our <hi>Father,</hi> and as our <hi>Shepheard.</hi> Therefore that the Pſalmiſt might better leave it for an enlarged ſupply as that a Heavenly heart might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept it, he ſaith not as in the former, ſo doe our eyes wait upon the <hi>hand</hi> of the Lord, but ſo doe our eyes wait upon the <hi>Lord.</hi> That is the reaſon of the third va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation.</p>
                  <p>There are but two obſervable beſides, I ſhall ſtand a little longer on them, they are materiall.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, why he doubles this word of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, upon <hi>the Lord our God?</hi> For <hi>one</hi> word would have ſerved (but that no word can ſerve to ſet out that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, but) having named <hi>Maſter</hi> before, one would think it ſhould run, ſo doe our eyes waite upon our <hi>Heavenly Maſter,</hi> as our Heavenly <hi>Lord,</hi> but he adds, <hi>the Lord our God.</hi> To ſhew the difference between the Maſters of the <hi>World,</hi> and of him that is <hi>above.</hi> The Maſters here <hi>below</hi> are Maſters indeed, but they are <hi>men</hi> like our <hi>ſelves,</hi> our Maſter above is the <hi>Lord our God.</hi> The Maſters here, that have dominion are <hi>Domini,</hi> but <hi>ſub domino,</hi> under that <hi>great</hi> Maſter, but he is <hi>Dominans dominantium,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi> They are Maſters that have their <hi>breath in their Noſtrills,</hi> but he is the Maſter that gives <hi>life, and breath,</hi> and motion, and <hi>all</hi> things. Therefore to ſhew that we ſtand in a <hi>double</hi> Obligation to God, in our ſervice, and attendance, he adds <hi>two</hi> words; we wait upon him as our <hi>glorious</hi> Lord, and as our <hi>gracious</hi> God, both wayes we give him our eyes and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:114893:222"/>attendance. To ſhew this double obligation, obſerve in the firſt line, the preſcription, the Coppie, there are both <hi>relations</hi> mentioned, and a double <hi>notion</hi> to both relations, there is <hi>Maſters,</hi> and <hi>Miſtreſſe, Servants,</hi> and <hi>Hand-maid.</hi> To note thus much, by the doubling of the one, that if there be any <hi>better</hi> ſervice in the <hi>one</hi> ſex then in the <hi>other,</hi> we are to draw the patterne from <hi>that,</hi> that we may give the <hi>pureſt</hi> ſervice, and attendance to God. And noting in the other, if there be <hi>any</hi> reſpect due to either of thoſe, <hi>Maſters,</hi> or <hi>Miſtreſſe,</hi> they ſhould be <hi>both</hi> drowned, and ſwallowed up in our reſpect to God, he uſeth both words, to ſhew, that we ſhould yeild <hi>all</hi> ſervice to God.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Commentary on the Pſalmes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the Queſtion, and ſo doth <hi>Jerome,</hi> if that be his, he finds a double ſcruple, he makes two Queſtions. One Queſtion is, why we are called <hi>Anſilla,</hi> in the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> number a <hi>Hand-maid?</hi> Another Queſtion is, why Chriſt is called not onely <hi>Dominus,</hi> but <hi>Domina.</hi> As the eyes of <hi>Servants</hi> wait on their <hi>Maſters,</hi> ſo doe our eyes upon <hi>Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives this reaſon, and <hi>Jerome,</hi> and it is full of wit, both theſe predications will hold for us that are Chriſtians. It is <hi>Servi ſumus, ancilla ſumus,</hi> we are both <hi>Servants,</hi> and we are the <hi>Church,</hi> we are <hi>Servants</hi> of his <hi>Handmaid.</hi> As we are the <hi>people</hi> of God, ſo we are called <hi>Servants;</hi> as we are the <hi>Church</hi> of God, ſo we are <hi>ancilla.</hi> So for the other predication, <hi>our Lord,</hi> and Saviour is both <hi>Dominus,</hi> and <hi>Domina.</hi> He is <hi>The Lord, Our Lord,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>our God,</hi> and <hi>Domina,</hi> he muſt have the duty of a <hi>Miſtreſſe,</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>virtue,</hi> and <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and excellency of <hi>God.</hi> That is <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins,</hi> and <hi>Jeromes.</hi> It is full of <hi>wit,</hi> but it is a little to adventerous. I durſt hardly to mention it if it were not theirs, their wit is ſweet, and in their intentions full
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:114893:222"/>of piety, but I dare not give it as a truth.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is reaſon to be given why <hi>both</hi> are expreſt, to ſhew the ſervice that we owe to God. The reaſon is this, <hi>both</hi> words are uſed, becauſe no <hi>one</hi> word can ſet out any part of Gods excellency, look in what part you will. There is no <hi>one</hi> word can ſet out the glory of God in <hi>Heaven,</hi> therefore there are <hi>two</hi> words uſed, the glory of <hi>both</hi> lights, the glory of the light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and of the <hi>Moone.</hi> There is no <hi>one</hi> word can ſet out to us the perfection of the <hi>robe</hi> of Chriſts <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> that he cloaths Beleivers with; therefore <hi>two</hi> words are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he cloaths them with double Ornaments, of the <hi>Bride-groome,</hi> and of the <hi>Bride, Iſa.</hi> 61. There is no <hi>one</hi> word can ſet out the <hi>propinquity</hi> of our alliance to Chriſt, therefore Chriſt ſets it out by <hi>two</hi> words. <hi>He that doth the will of my Father is my Brother, and Siſter.</hi> There is no one word can ſet out the <hi>tenderneſſe</hi> of the <hi>love</hi> of God, therefore it is ſet out by the love of <hi>both</hi> Parents, by the love of a <hi>Father,</hi> and a <hi>Mother. Can a Mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her Child?</hi> And <hi>as a Father pirties his Child, ſo the Lord hath mercy on them that feare him.</hi> In Gods love there is the love of <hi>both</hi> Parents, the <hi>conſtant</hi> love of the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>tender</hi> love of the <hi>Mother.</hi> One word cannot ſet it out. So here, becauſe <hi>all dominion</hi> is due to God, and we are to pay him, <hi>all ſubjection,</hi> and ſervice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one word cannot ſet it out, there are words of <hi>both</hi> ſexes uſed, there is a <hi>relative</hi> to be found in <hi>both</hi> ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, <hi>Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Miſtreſſe,</hi> and inferiours, <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>Hand-maid. As the eyes of Servants, and Hand-maids, ſo our eyes waite upon the Lord our God.</hi> There is mention of <hi>both</hi> ſexes in <hi>our</hi> propinquity to Chriſt, and <hi>his</hi> neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us; that is the reaſon that both theſe are ſet downe, <hi>So doe our eyes waite upon the Lord our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifth, and laſt, is that that makes the paralell, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:114893:223"/>proportion to all the former, there hangs the meaning, <hi>So.</hi> As the eyes of Servants, <hi>So</hi> doe our eyes. And here now there is a great deale of matter in this word. It argued a ſweet temper in the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> that he that was ſo great a <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> yet thought it his greateſt honour to call himſelfe by the name of Gods <hi>Servant.</hi> Nay, there was yet a greater ſubmiſſion, he did not onely reckon himſelfe in the number of <hi>Gods</hi> Servants, but he learned this leſſon from the duty that Servants give their <hi>Maſters,</hi> he ſtooped ſo low as to men of <hi>meane</hi> condition to be inſtructed.</p>
                  <p>It is a leſſon you may learne from your <hi>Servants,</hi> ſee what duty they give you, give you the ſame to <hi>God.</hi> So it ſeems to be but one argument, but there are foure in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>De facto,</hi> from the thing that was done, as <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> give <hi>all</hi> reſpect to their <hi>Maſters,</hi> ſo will we to God.</p>
                  <p>Then, <hi>De jure,</hi> as Servants <hi>ſhould</hi> give reſpect to their Maſters, ſo will <hi>we.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an argument taken from the <hi>equality, as, ſo,</hi> we will doe it ſo <hi>chearfully</hi> as they doe, our <hi>delight</hi> ſhall be in the <hi>Lord,</hi> as they delight in their <hi>Masters.</hi> We will doe it ſo <hi>properly</hi> as they doe, we will wait on him in <hi>all</hi> things, whatſoever he Commands us, we will doe; ſo they doe to their Maſters: we will doe it as <hi>plainly,</hi> and <hi>evidently.</hi> A good Chriſtian looks on God ſo plainly that he conſiders him as <hi>neare</hi> him as the <hi>Maſter</hi> is to the <hi>Servant,</hi> God is alway at <hi>hand.</hi> What ſhall I ſay? <hi>So,</hi> that is, ſo <hi>excellently,</hi> ſo <hi>conſtantly,</hi> and <hi>comfortably;</hi> it is an argument taken from <hi>equality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay further, it is an argument that may be preſt from a <hi>greater</hi> dependence. <hi>So,</hi> nay much <hi>more</hi> ſhall our eyes wait on the Lord. There is the true <hi>height</hi> of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:114893:223"/>
                     <hi>We</hi> have more reaſon to wait upon <hi>God,</hi> then <hi>Servants</hi> on their <hi>Maſters.</hi> Servants have a <hi>compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and they deſerve it for their work, and ſervice; we doe <hi>no</hi> ſervice for God that <hi>deſerves</hi> any thing. Servants <hi>owe</hi> obedience to their Maſters, not <hi>ſimply,</hi> but in <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> to God; we owe duty, and reſpect to God <hi>ſimply.</hi> Servants, their eyes are fixed upon their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters here on <hi>Earth,</hi> our ſervice is to be continued in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Servants doe it for a <hi>time,</hi> our ſervice laſts <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</hi> Servants doe it for men of the ſame condition with themſelves; they give obedience to their Maſters, and yet have fellowſhip of <hi>nature</hi> with them, and have <hi>priviledges,</hi> and prerogatives of <hi>grace,</hi> commonly, they have the ſame title to <hi>Heaven,</hi> the ſame fellowſhip of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet they give true <hi>obedience</hi> to their Maſters, though they have fellowſhip in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>nature.</hi> There is no ſuch community between our <hi>great</hi> Maſter, and <hi>us</hi> Chriſtians, there is an infinite <hi>diſtance</hi> between God, and us, therefore we muſt doe <hi>more.</hi> God is infinitly <hi>gracious,</hi> he powres out more bleſſings, we have <hi>more</hi> good from him, ſo then, we ſhould not onely doe <hi>ſo,</hi> but <hi>more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore that is it now, that Chriſtians will lay hold on, to <hi>force</hi> the word; as <hi>David betters</hi> the <hi>coppie,</hi> ſo let us better the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> as <hi>Servants,</hi> ſo <hi>we,</hi> nay <hi>more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I muſt recall the word. O it were happy if we gave ſo much as Servants to their Maſters. Where is the man to be found that gives <hi>more</hi> obedience to God, then Servants to their Maſters, or that gives ſo <hi>much?</hi> Who gives ſo much to <hi>God</hi> as his <hi>Hireling</hi> doth to him? Who walks ſo <hi>faithfully</hi> to God, as a <hi>Servant</hi> that is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but for <hi>one</hi> Weeke doth to his Maſter? That is, who gives ſo much ſervice to God, as a <hi>good</hi> Servant to a <hi>good</hi>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:114893:224"/>Maſter? Nay more, as a <hi>good</hi> Servant to a <hi>bad</hi> Maſter? Nay further, as the <hi>worſt</hi> Servant to <hi>any</hi> Maſter? There is not the <hi>worſt</hi> Servant, but he gives obedience to <hi>any</hi> Maſter generally better then we doe to <hi>God.</hi> In the fore-noone I told you it was a fault, <hi>Servants</hi> are grown to an ill paſſe, they are <hi>unfaithfull;</hi> but now, <hi>Maſters</hi> will <hi>juſtifie</hi> Servants, if the <hi>Servants</hi> be <hi>ill,</hi> the <hi>Maſters</hi> are <hi>worſe.</hi> There is not the <hi>worſt</hi> Servant but may put us to <hi>

                  <p>The <hi>worſt</hi> Servants <hi>murmure</hi> when they are ill uſed by their Maſters; we <hi>grudge,</hi> and repine when God poures <hi>plenty</hi> in our laps.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The worſt Servant can but <hi>deſpiſe,</hi> and contemne his Maſter, he can but <hi>neglect</hi> his Commands, and his <hi>worke,</hi> and that work is <hi>corporall,</hi> we neglect the work of our Maſter, and it is a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> work, the great work of his <hi>glory,</hi> that brings good to our <hi>ſelves.</hi> We are <hi>worſe</hi> then
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:114893:224"/>the <hi>worſt</hi> Servant: there is not the worſt Servant in the World, but may be juſtified by the obedience that we give to God. Examine it by theſe two perticulars; we are glad to heare of God as a <hi>Father;</hi> ſee if we account him a <hi>Maſter:</hi> put the two Queſtions in the Prophet. <hi>If I be a Maſter, where is my feare? If I be a Father where is my honour?</hi> If God be our <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> where is his <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>feare?</hi> Here are the two Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if God be our <hi>Maſter,</hi> where is our <hi>livery?</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants goe in their Maſters <hi>cloath</hi> without ſhame. When I ſpeake of a <hi>badge,</hi> I ſpeake not of the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> badge of Chriſtianity, but of the <hi>temporall</hi> badge, for <hi>cloaths</hi> are of Gods beſtowing.</p>
                  <p>There are the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> cloaths, the habite of the <hi>mind,</hi> we caſt off that. For that livery, what conſiſts it in? In <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>holineſſe.</hi> Doe we deſire to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne our <hi>minds</hi> with theſe? Are we attired in our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>livery?</hi> To weare his collours? We cannot judge of the habite of the <hi>mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look on the habite of the <hi>body,</hi> are you in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>livery</hi> now a dayes? Doth God preſcribe ſuch <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> and <hi>follies,</hi> that Creatures ſhould delight to make themſelves <hi>Puppits,</hi> that they muſt be <hi>flouted</hi> at, doth God preſcribe <hi>ſuch</hi> apparell? <hi>Rich</hi> apparell is as due to them that are <hi>great,</hi> as <hi>meane</hi> apparell to them that are <hi>inferiour.</hi> So that there be due <hi>order,</hi> and caution kept, that they eſtrangenot the <hi>mind</hi> from God, that they take not up too much time, that it be in the compaſſe of <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety.</hi> But this makes Chriſtianity diſdained, we ſteale all from God. Is this <hi>Gods livery?</hi> Did he appoint you to goe with <hi>naked</hi> Breaſts, and naked <hi>Armes?</hi> Did not he appoint apparell to cover the <hi>ſhame</hi> of ſin? Did any of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preſcribe it ſo? See what the Apoſtle ſayth, you are to be adorned as becomes <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> and

Are you in <hi>Gods livery?</hi> Is <hi>Chriſt</hi> your Maſter? If you be, then you may make a good account at the <hi>laſt</hi> day; but if there be a <hi>diſtinction</hi> to be made, there it will appeare who are his <hi>Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if God be your Maſter, where is your <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</hi> Obedience is the <hi>peoper</hi> duty of <hi>Servants;</hi> take away <hi>obedience,</hi> you deſtroy the nature of <hi>Servants.</hi> If we give obedienco to <hi>God,</hi> where are Gods <hi>Commands? What</hi> are Gods Commands? St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> goes about to ſee if he can reckon them. Sayth he, God might have ſaid if his nature were <hi>capable,</hi> as other <hi>Maſters</hi> ſay to their <hi>Servants,</hi> wait upon me to <hi>bed,</hi> while I <hi>reſt,</hi> wait upon me to the <hi>Bath,</hi> while I <hi>waſh</hi> me; wait at my <hi>Table</hi> when I take <hi>ſuſtenance.</hi> No, God needs not theſe <hi>inferiour</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; but then, what doth he command? <hi>Wait</hi> upon me in mine <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and in my <hi>Commands,</hi> in my <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> in my <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> that I require at thy hands. Here is the rule, are theſe thoſe that we keep? If <hi>God</hi> be our Maſter, where are his <hi>Commands?</hi> Where is our <hi>work?</hi> Doe we think the work of Chriſtianity, the <hi>work</hi> that God hath appointed us? Doe we think that that was the <hi>end</hi> why we were ſent into the World, to work out our <hi>Salvation?</hi> If we think not of <hi>this,</hi> we are not <hi>Servants.</hi> There is not the <hi>worſt</hi> Servant but he comes into his Maſters Houſe to doe ſervice. We have entered into our Maſters <hi>houſe,</hi> we have taken <hi>Preſſe</hi>-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be Gods <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and to be his <hi>Servants,</hi> then, where is his <hi>work?</hi> Is that left undone? Look but what Chriſt will ſay at the <hi>laſt</hi> day, when they ſhall be called to account. <hi>Well done good and faithfull Servant. Take away the unprofitable Servant.</hi> Certainly, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell</hi> the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> theſe words ſhall be ſaid at the laſt day, where is thy <hi>work?</hi>
                     <pb n="415" facs="tcp:114893:225"/>Where is thy <hi>account?</hi> What haſt thou <hi>done?</hi> How haſt thou <hi>behaved</hi> thy ſelfe? If we caſt off Gods <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> we caſt off our <hi>relation:</hi> if we be not under <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> we are not under a <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Beloved, recall your ſelves, remember that it is that that the <hi>beame</hi> of Chriſtianity hangs on; it is a high <hi>honour</hi> to be Gods <hi>Servant,</hi> more then to be the <hi>Heire</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> O what a credit is it to retaine to ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter! To belong to <hi>God,</hi> what an <hi>honour</hi> is it! He is ſuch a Maſter that promiſeth <hi>better</hi> freedome then other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and ties himſelfe to us, and us to him in <hi>more</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, and ſets us an <hi>eaſier</hi> task, but to <hi>work out our owne Salvation;</hi> and payes us <hi>better</hi> wages. Take all the <hi>Princes</hi> in the World, that are ſo <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>glorious,</hi> and ſo able to <hi>reward</hi> their Servants, put them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are <hi>as the duſt of the Ballance,</hi> both <hi>they,</hi> and their <hi>rewards,</hi> in compariſon to the <hi>reward</hi> that <hi>God</hi> gives to the <hi>worſt</hi> Servant of his. Stir up your ſelves from the conſideration of <hi>Servants.</hi> God gives you out <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>bleſſing,</hi> ſtir up your ſelves to give true, and faithfull ſervice to Chriſt. Never look on your <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> but think you are <hi>Gods</hi> Servants. When your Servants teſtifie <hi>their</hi> obedience to you, make <hi>Davids</hi> uſe of it, bring it to this leſſon, if we cannot <hi>exceed</hi> theſe Servants, remember to <hi>equall</hi> them, <hi>So, So doe our eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The equality will appeare by comparing, ſo you ſhall ſee, both the duty of <hi>good</hi> Servants to their <hi>Maſters,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>good</hi> Servants delight in their Maſters <hi>preſence,</hi> ſo ſhould we in the preſence of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>good</hi> Servants put on the ſame <hi>affections</hi> with their Maſters. A good Servant as <hi>Euripides</hi> ſayth, <hi>rejoyceth</hi> if his Maſter be <hi>chearfull,</hi> and <hi>grieves</hi> if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be <hi>ſorrowfull,</hi> he puts on the <hi>ſame</hi> affection. We
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:114893:226"/>muſt put on the <hi>ſame</hi> affection with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> doe <hi>I not hate them that hate thee?</hi> Doeſt thou <hi>love</hi> them that <hi>God hates?</hi> We muſt put on the ſame affections with God (though we muſt hate none) put on <hi>Chriſts</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>walke in love,</hi> be <hi>humble,</hi> and <hi>mercifull,</hi> as he is. This is to have the nature of Servants.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Servants are not <hi>Sui juris,</hi> to <hi>walke</hi> where they liſt, and <hi>doe</hi> what they liſt, but they muſt doe the <hi>will</hi> of their <hi>Maſters,</hi> they are not at their <hi>owne</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no more are we, we are not our <hi>owne,</hi> we are not <hi>Sui juris,</hi> your Maſter hath <hi>bought</hi> you, and <hi>redeemed</hi> you out of captivity.</p>
                  <p>Servants will <hi>greive,</hi> to heare the <hi>name</hi> of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>evill</hi> ſpoken of. He is an <hi>unworthy</hi> Servant that can heare the <hi>name</hi> of his Maſter touched, and doth not as far as is <hi>modeſt,</hi> to his <hi>power</hi> vindicate it. So we muſt <hi>greive,</hi> and be <hi>zealouſly</hi> affected when we heare that <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> name blaſphemed, by which we are called.</p>
                  <p>A Servant is ſorry if his Maſters affaires <hi>ſucceed</hi> not well; he labours to <hi>accommodate</hi> his Maſter, and to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> him in every thing. It is a great <hi>diſcontent</hi> to a Servant, if things <hi>thrive</hi> not with his Maſter. So we ſhould <hi>greive,</hi> when Gods affairs goe not well on (though God will make them ſucceed, yet) when things goe not well with the <hi>Church,</hi> and Children of God, we ſhould lay it to heart.</p>
                  <p>Againe, good Servants <hi>wait</hi> upon their Maſters for <hi>all</hi> things, for <hi>Meat,</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> and <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and <hi>Wages,</hi> and <hi>Proviſion,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtody,</hi> and <hi>Defence,</hi> and when they get theſe things, when they have <hi>Wages</hi> from them, they give them <hi>thanks,</hi> though they have wrought <hi>hard,</hi> and they pay them upon <hi>Covenant</hi> made. God gives <hi>plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> wages, let us be <hi>thankfull</hi> to him, and <hi>wait</hi> upon him for <hi>all</hi> we have, as Servants upon their Maſters.</p>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:114893:226"/>
                  <p>Againe, good Servants doe not take upon them to <hi>preſcribe</hi> their Maſters, either <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>manner;</hi> they will not tell their Maſters what they deſire to doe, and what <hi>they</hi> will <hi>have</hi> themſelves, but they <hi>wait</hi> on their Maſters, to receive their direction. We muſt not <hi>preſcribe</hi> God, leave God to <hi>his</hi> way, though we ſee things improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, God can work it <hi>out,</hi> we muſt leave him to his <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> he will bring things to paſſe; we muſt not put truſt in <hi>meanes,</hi> and <hi>rules,</hi> but leave God to his preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, good Servants beare their Maſters <hi>name,</hi> and not onely apply themſelves to the <hi>Commands</hi> of their Maſter, but to the <hi>deſires</hi> of their Maſter. They alway conſider themſelves to be in that condition, that they look to give an <hi>account.</hi> Good Servants they are not onely <hi>tender</hi> of their Maſters <hi>temporall</hi> goods, but of their Maſters <hi>ſafety.</hi> A good Servant will venture his <hi>life</hi> for his Maſter, eſpecially in a <hi>good</hi> cauſe.</p>
                  <p>O then, let us goe, and be <hi>like</hi> minded; put all theſe together, and by the conſideration of theſe things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke our ſelves to the <hi>faithfull</hi> obedience, and ſervice that belongs to <hi>God.</hi> Let us <hi>mold</hi> our ſelves with <hi>theſe</hi> reſolutions. If we be <hi>Servants,</hi> for ſhame, for ſhame, doe ſomewhat that belongs to <hi>Servants.</hi> Let us not be content to <hi>equall</hi> the Coppie, but labour to <hi>exceed</hi> it; not onely to ſay, <hi>As the eyes of Servants, ſo our eyes,</hi> but as the eyes of <hi>Children</hi> to their <hi>Parents,</hi> ſo are <hi>our</hi> eyes to <hi>God.</hi> As the eyes of <hi>Subjects</hi> are to their <hi>Prince,</hi> ſo are <hi>our</hi> eyes on <hi>God:</hi> and as the eyes of <hi>Sheep,</hi> are fixed upon the <hi>Shepheard,</hi> ſo are <hi>our</hi> eyes on <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the eyes of <hi>Creatures</hi> are upon their <hi>Creator,</hi> and the eyes of the <hi>redeemed</hi> upon their <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo <hi>our</hi> eyes are fixed upon the <hi>Lord our God.</hi> In all theſe relations we will not onely labour to <hi>equall</hi> the duty, but to <hi>exceed</hi> it,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:114893:227"/>and not <hi>ſo</hi> onely, but <hi>more.</hi> So I have done with the firſt thing, the paralell, wherein <hi>David</hi> endeavours to match the Coppy he had propounded, <hi>As the eyes of Servants are towards their Maſters, ſo are our eyes on the Lord our God.</hi> And the reaſon of every word.</p>
                  <p>Now the laſt thing is the <hi>date,</hi> and <hi>duration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill he have mercy on us.</q>
                  <p>There are but <hi>two</hi> words, they are not long in <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation;</hi> but they are very long in <hi>ſignification.</hi> They are ſo long that they reach to <hi>perpetuity</hi> both wayes. For firſt, there is no end of Gods <hi>mercy,</hi> that is <hi>one</hi> word. And then, there muſt be no period ſet of our <hi>duty,</hi> and waiting, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill he have mercy on us.</hi> That word ſeems to be as long as the other. Indeed it is true, in it <hi>ſelfe</hi> it is not <hi>long,</hi> becauſe God is not long in ſhewing <hi>mercy,</hi> he is <hi>quick,</hi> if we ſhould wait upon him onely till he ſhew <hi>mercy,</hi> we ſhould <hi>wait</hi> now, and no <hi>longer,</hi> we ſhould ceaſe preſently: for he ſhews mercy <hi>alwayes.</hi> No, but it is to be continued by <hi>many</hi> enlargements, therefore briefly, the ſum of <hi>both</hi> words is this. In one word, the word <hi>mercy, David</hi> ſets downe the <hi>ſcope</hi> at which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian aimes after the <hi>glory of God,</hi> in ſhooting up all thoſe Arrows of <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> that he ſends up to God, the <hi>end,</hi> and aime of <hi>all</hi> is this, that he may attaine <hi>mercy,</hi> he looks up to God for <hi>mercy. Mercy</hi> that is of a <hi>larg</hi> ſignification, we can beg <hi>nothing</hi> of God which is not <hi>mercy.</hi> If a man be <hi>diſconſolate,</hi> he looks to God for <hi>comfort.</hi> If there be a <hi>doubtfull</hi> heart that looks up to God for <hi>reſolution.</hi> If there be a <hi>blind</hi> heart, that looks for <hi>illumination:</hi> of a <hi>wavering</hi> heart, that looks for <hi>ſtabliſhing;</hi> all theſe are <hi>mercies,</hi> becauſe they are all given in <hi>mercy.</hi> Every <hi>good</hi> thing is a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:114893:227"/>becauſe it is <hi>given</hi> in <hi>mercy.</hi> If a man be in <hi>perſecution, peace</hi> is a mercy. If he be in <hi>trouble</hi> of Conſcience, <hi>eaſe</hi> is a mercy. If he be in <hi>anguiſh,</hi> if he be in <hi>any</hi> exigent, <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> is a mercy. If he be in <hi>pangs</hi> of Conſcience, <hi>quiet</hi> is a mercy. <hi>All</hi> is <hi>mercy,</hi> he that waits on God for <hi>mercy,</hi> waits for every <hi>good</hi> thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the other word, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill,</hi> ſhews us thus much, what the <hi>period</hi> is, that a Chriſtian ſets himſelfe in the line of <hi>obedience.</hi> It hath the ſame period that <hi>Donec</hi> untill, <hi>untill</hi> he ſhews mercy. Shall we think that <hi>David</hi> did meane to wait on God <hi>untill</hi> he had mercy, and then to <hi>fix</hi> his eyes upon the <hi>Earth</hi> againe? No, much <hi>more</hi> then, therefore know that the word <hi>Donec</hi> in Scripture, doth not alway ſignifie a <hi>determinate</hi> time, but an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> time, <hi>untill</hi> ſignifies <hi>eternity</hi> in two places. One in the Goſpell, <hi>Joſeph</hi> knew not <hi>Mary untill</hi> ſhee had brought forth her firſt Borne Son; not <hi>then,</hi> nor <hi>after,</hi> becauſe ſhee continued alway a <hi>Virgin.</hi> But more plainly in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord, ſit on my right hand, untill I make thine enemies thy Foot-ſtoole.</hi> Doe you think that Chriſt ſhall ſit at Gods right hand no <hi>longer</hi> then till all things be <hi>ſubdued</hi> in the end of the <hi>World,</hi> and that then he ſhall give over his <hi>ſeſſion,</hi> and his <hi>Kingdome</hi> ceaſe? God forbid, but <hi>untill</hi> is for <hi>ever.</hi> So here, <hi>Our eyes wait on the Lord till he have mercy on us.</hi> Not as we ſhould make a <hi>ceſſation</hi> then, when God hath ſhewed <hi>mercy.</hi> But as St. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> very well, he ſpeaks not onely for a <hi>ſhort</hi> time, as <hi>long</hi> as God ſhews <hi>mercy,</hi> but for <hi>all</hi> times. What doe I take <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> heare <hi>David</hi> expound himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. <hi>My throat is dry, my heart is weary, mine eyes faile with waiting.</hi> He looked on God ſo <hi>long</hi> till his eyes <hi>failed,</hi> and he gives not <hi>over</hi> then, he waits <hi>still.</hi> A Chriſtian muſt wait alwayes upon God. So that word hath both an <hi>incluſive,</hi>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:114893:228"/>and an <hi>excluſive</hi> force. <hi>So ſhall our eyes wait on the Lord, untill he ſhew mercy.</hi> That is, if he <hi>doe</hi> ſhew mercy, we will <hi>wait,</hi> or if he doe <hi>not.</hi> If he ſend it <hi>ſpeedily,</hi> or if he doe <hi>not,</hi> ſtill God is to be <hi>waited</hi> on. We now, if God doe <hi>not</hi> ſend mercy, we will <hi>wait</hi> on him with <hi>contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or if he <hi>doe</hi> ſhew mercy we will wait on him with <hi>acknowledgement.</hi> If God <hi>delay</hi> mercy, we will wait with <hi>patience;</hi> if he <hi>ſpeedily</hi> ſend mercy, we will wait on him with <hi>thankfullneſſe;</hi> we will wait on him till <hi>then,</hi> and much more, <hi>after. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill,</hi> that is, I will wait on him <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>now,</hi> and <hi>alway,</hi> we will never end this work. So the point is this,</p>
                  <q>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> true Chriſtian muſt not let goe his hold, his hope, his confidence, he breaks not off his Service, he breaks not off waiting upon God, though God deferre to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</q>
                  <p>He waits on God in his <hi>owne</hi> occaſions, though God <hi>ſuſpend,</hi> and ſeeme to <hi>abſent</hi> himſelfe.

Here is the point, a Chriſtian muſt not <hi>give over</hi> waiting on God, eſpecially in caſes of <hi>extreamity.</hi> When we come to beg any mercy, <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> or <hi>temporall,</hi> of God, if God beſtow it on us, then we are ſaid to wait <hi>till</hi> then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then we obtaine our deſire; we wait for <hi>other</hi> mercies <hi>alway,</hi> for <hi>generall</hi> mercies <hi>every</hi> day.</p>
                  <p>And it is a point now worth the conſidering in theſe times, becauſe the ſtate of our times is ſo, that every man almoſt is ready to <hi>let goe</hi> his <hi>confidence.</hi> If things <hi>ſucceed</hi> not in <hi>every</hi> perticular according to our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deſires, then we think the whole <hi>Chaine</hi> of providence is <hi>diſſolved,</hi> if one linck be looſed, we think
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:114893:228"/>
                     <hi>all</hi> the buſineſſe is <hi>overturned,</hi> and all our hopes <hi>diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,</hi> if God anſwer us not in our time upon every occaſion. The reaſon is, we know not what it is to <hi>wait</hi> on God.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, it is true, if God were tied to <hi>one</hi> way, or <hi>meanes,</hi> or to one <hi>time,</hi> or to any one <hi>perſon,</hi> or to any one <hi>inſtrument,</hi> there were good cauſe that we ſhould <hi>ſuſpect</hi> our hold in the ſucceſſe of the affaires of the <hi>Church</hi> at all times, then we had good cauſe to be <hi>feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>ſtraightened</hi> ſo much, he hath <hi>wayes</hi> that we know not, and <hi>times</hi> that we underſtand not of; and <hi>perſons</hi> he can make to ſpring out of the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of them that are taken away, that are <hi>contemptible</hi> in our eyes, and God can ſtrengthen them, though they be as the <hi>ſhaking</hi> of an <hi>Olive.</hi> God will <hi>perfect</hi> this work if <hi>we</hi> be not the <hi>impediment,</hi> if our <hi>ſins</hi> ſtay him not, if we <hi>wait.</hi> It is true, I confeſſe it pleaſeth me exceedingly, and I <hi>congratulate,</hi> and rejoyce: your <hi>deſires</hi> almoſt as much affect me with <hi>joy,</hi> as the <hi>other</hi> with <hi>ſorrow,</hi> to ſee men in <hi>amazement</hi> at ſuch a time, It is a ſigne of your <hi>love</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> beyond the Seas: yet how unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was it upon the <hi>firſt</hi> relation? No man knew what to <hi>ſpeake,</hi> or what to <hi>think?</hi> It is a ſigne that <hi>Religion</hi> hath taken ſome <hi>impreſſion.</hi> It is a ſigne that you have a ſimpathy with the Servants of God, it is a ſigne that you have the <hi>affections</hi> of <hi>Servants</hi> towards God. But for all this, take heed while you doe right to the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of God, that you doe not injury to <hi>God</hi> himſelfe: becauſe <hi>he is faithfull that hath promiſed.</hi> Remember he orders the affairs himſelfe. God can raiſe up a <hi>Joſuah</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> room; I rather uſe the word, becauſe I am very much delighted with the Simile of that noble, victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Prince,</hi> he was a <hi>Moſes, Was,</hi> ſaid I? O that is a <hi>wounding</hi> word that you cannot endure: O that I could
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:114893:229"/>ſay <hi>he is,</hi> and yet I cannot ſay the contrary, we are kept betweene <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> though it be more to be <hi>feared</hi> then <hi>hoped,</hi> in that particular I am afraid. But whether <hi>was,</hi> or <hi>is,</hi> like <hi>Moſes</hi> he was, and if he be, <hi>Is,</hi> God was with <hi>him</hi> as he was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the leading of his People. He came into <hi>Germany</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with a greater band, but a <hi>ſmall</hi> traine in reſpect of the Enemies, but God turned his weakneſſe to ſtrength. He was <hi>faithfull</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, he ſought not himſelfe as <hi>Moſes</hi> did not. <hi>Moſes</hi> brought the Children of Iſrael out of the <hi>Furnace;</hi> he brought the poore afflicted of <hi>Germany,</hi> a <hi>good</hi> way out of the Furnace. And now that all may be like <hi>Moſes, Moſes Sepulcher</hi> is not known to <hi>this</hi> day, and the <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>death</hi> of that <hi>excellent</hi> Prince, is not yet knowne to this day, like <hi>Moſes</hi> Sepulcher.</p>
                  <p>There is yet our <hi>perplexity,</hi> yet there is our <hi>comfort;</hi> there is ſome comfort in that word that it is <hi>uncertaine:</hi> for that that is uncertaine may be <hi>otherwiſe;</hi> O, but I think that it may be. Howſoever be it ſo, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>God</hi> hath done <hi>his</hi> part; he hath not left us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>comfort.</hi> See but how he hath tempered <hi>ſad</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings with a mixture of <hi>comfort;</hi> he hath tempered the loſſe with gaine, there is <hi>ſorrow</hi> with <hi>joy,</hi> there is <hi>feare</hi> with <hi>hope,</hi> there is <hi>loſſe</hi> with <hi>Victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why then, if God doe thus to us, and ſo <hi>feed</hi> us with his <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>ſupport</hi> our longanimity, if he ply us thus, have we not reaſon to <hi>wait</hi> upon him?</p>
                  <p>Let us now run to this word in the Text. <hi>Behold, as the eyes of Servants wait on their Masters, ſo doe our eyes wait on God till he have mercy on us,</hi> and <hi>alwayes,</hi> but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>then.</hi> For did you but know the <hi>comfort</hi> that comes by <hi>hope,</hi> and expectation; innumerable comforts come from <hi>hope.</hi>

                  <p>Hope is the <hi>Anchor</hi> of the ſoule, as the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it.

                  <p>It is a <hi>better</hi> Anchor then other Anchors, they are alway <hi>below</hi> the Ship, at the ground; but this Anchor is <hi>above,</hi> it is not faſtened in <hi>Earth,</hi> but in <hi>Heaven.</hi>

                     <hi>David, I waited patiently on the Lord, and God heard me.</hi> It is confirmed, and ratified by promiſes. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſets one, <hi>Waite on the Lord, and he will ſave thee. David</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Wait on the Lord, and he will preſerve thy ſoule; Wait patiently on the Lord, and he will bring it to paſſe.</hi> We have it ratified by promiſe. Nay, in <hi>experience,</hi> who ever waited, and was fruſtrated? <hi>Our Fathers truſted in God, and were not aſhamed, he gave them their hearts deſire:</hi> and he hath <hi>exceeded</hi> ours; therefore have recourſe to that <hi>Anchor,</hi> and learne what it is to <hi>wait</hi> on God, that we may ſay as <hi>Job, Though he kill me, I will truſt in him.</hi> Though he <hi>diſappoint</hi> all, I will <hi>hope;</hi> my hope, and waiting ſhall be placed on <hi>God,</hi> my truſt ſhall be in him, he never ſuffered, that ſtaid his <hi>leaſure</hi> to be <hi>aſhamed;</hi> they were had in <hi>remembrance.</hi> Therefore our eyes ſhall <hi>wait</hi> on him as the eyes of <hi>Servants;</hi> nay, not onely ſo, but if that be not enough, we wil not onely <hi>wait</hi> but <hi>hang</hi> upon him, &amp; not onely ſo, but in a holy ſence <hi>wreſtle</hi> with him by Prayer, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, that he would be <hi>mercifull</hi> to his People, that he would take care ſtill of that little part of the <hi>Ark, floating</hi> on the Waters. Nay, we will not onely <hi>wait</hi> upon him as <hi>Servants,</hi> but as <hi>Children;</hi> and not onely with the <hi>eyes</hi> of Children, but with the <hi>Teares</hi> of Children, with <hi>eyes fixed,</hi> and <hi>hands ſpread,</hi> and <hi>knees bowed,</hi> with <hi>lips opening,</hi> and <hi>hearts mounting,</hi> we will <hi>wait</hi> upon him; that this hope may be <hi>fixed</hi> in all our <hi>faces,</hi> and ſhine in all parts: thus if we doe we ſhall make the Text compleat.</p>
                  <p>For concluſion of all.

This <hi>hope,</hi> and waiting will <hi>ſtabliſh</hi> the ſoule in both. Take the rule of both. For uncertainty, doe as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, take theſe letters of <hi>uncertaine</hi> rumours, and ſpread them
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:114893:230"/>before the Lord. For the <hi>feare,</hi> let us take our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and caſt our ſelves before the Lord, at his <hi>Footſtoole.</hi> For the <hi>uncertainty,</hi> let that be the Scripture. <hi>Habak.</hi> 2. <hi>The Viſion is yet for an appointed time, but in the end it ſhall ſpeake, and ſhall not lie. It ſhall come, and ſhall not tarry.</hi> Though it <hi>tarry,</hi> yet we will <hi>wait</hi> for it. For the <hi>feare,</hi> let this be the word to fix our hearts, that <hi>David</hi> hath given opportunity to handle this day. <hi>Behold,</hi> though our <hi>feares</hi> be <hi>great,</hi> yet our <hi>hopes</hi> are <hi>ſome:</hi> therefore <hi>as the eyes of Servants look to the hands of their Maſters, and the eyes of a Maiden to the hands of her Miſtreſſe, ſo doe our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, untill he have mercy on his people.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Text is not the <hi>Scripture</hi> for the <hi>day,</hi> but it is next of kin to it; it is the <hi>Story</hi> for the <hi>day,</hi> though not the Chapter, for it is the very ſame Story that out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evangeliſt is appointed for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of this day, and you lately heard it read to you. But I choſe rather to handle it out of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> becauſe that part which makes for my purpoſe is
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:114893:233"/>more fully ſet downe by him. And indeed betweene the two Evangeliſts, in the recording of the Story we ſhall find that there is ſome difference, though it may be eaſily ſalved: For St. <hi>Matthew</hi> in Chap. 26. he ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it; as if the motion of preparing the Paſſover, came firſt from the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt: but St. <hi>Luke</hi> in this Chapter, he ſo relates it, as if the motion of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Paſſover, came firſt from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the very next words doe make it plaine to us, where he ſhews, that the firſt motion of the <hi>thing</hi> came from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but the firſt motion of the <hi>place</hi> came from the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt: Therefore St. <hi>Matthew</hi> when he tells us of the Diſciples of Chriſt propounding to their Maſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preparation of the Paſſover, I ſuppoſe the <hi>firſt</hi> precept went from Chriſt, he gave them charge to goe and prepare, as it is in <hi>Luke;</hi> then they goe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Queſtion concerning the <hi>place, Where wilt thou that we prepare?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And both theſe conſiderations even in the entrance of this Scripture, might be uſefull for us; for, in the Narration that is made by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> we have here propounded to us, what is the duty of a godly <hi>Servant,</hi> he will put his <hi>Maſter</hi> in mind of matters that are <hi>weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and important, not onely ſuch as concerne the <hi>world,</hi> but ſuch as concerne <hi>Religion.</hi> If we follow the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> there is ſet downe the duty of a godly, and religious <hi>Maſter,</hi> to call upon his Servant to excite him to be <hi>frequent,</hi> and <hi>zealous,</hi> in the work of the Lord, in the ſervice of God. According to the method that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> followes, there we may ſee the part of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>people,</hi> of a good <hi>Flock,</hi> they will in caſe even ſpeake to their <hi>Pastor,</hi> and call upon him for the practiſe of thoſe duties that belong to him, and we will take it well at your hands. Chriſt <hi>himſelfe</hi> was pleaſed to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:114893:233"/>himſelfe to be <hi>remembred</hi> by his Diſciples: God <hi>himſelfe</hi> ſuffereth himſelfe to be <hi>remembred</hi> by us, when we call for thoſe things we need. But if we follow the method of <hi>Luke,</hi> ſo you ſhall ſee what is the duty of a <hi>carefull,</hi> vigilant <hi>Paſtor,</hi> he will oft <hi>ſtir</hi> up his <hi>People,</hi> his Flock, his Pariſh, to conſider what they are doing when they come to the ſervice of God, to whoſe <hi>houſe</hi> they come, whoſe <hi>Table</hi> they repaire to, whoſe <hi>Word</hi> they heare, before <hi>whome</hi> it is that they caſt downe themſelves; ſtill he will call upon them to <hi>prepare</hi> for the <hi>Paſſover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were I guilty of any <hi>great</hi> neglect, Beloved, I would hope that ſome of you would be ſo friendly as to <hi>call</hi> upon me, to put me in <hi>mind;</hi> and yet I have cauſe to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> that rather the moſt would be ſo negligent as to let me <hi>alone,</hi> willing to enjoy in my <hi>idlenes</hi> their owne <hi>ſecurity.</hi> Therefore you ſhall give me leave now to <hi>prevent</hi> you, as Chriſt did here his Diſciples, to ſpeake to <hi>you</hi> that you make <hi>ready</hi> for the <hi>Paſſover;</hi> the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, why is there any Paſſover now to be kept among Chriſtians? Yes, if you doe not know it the Apoſtle will tell you that Chriſt is our Paſſover, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. He that prepares himſelfe for the applying of the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, and the procuring of himſelfe greater intereſt in the <hi>merit</hi> of his Paſſion, he <hi>prepares</hi> for the <hi>Paſſover.</hi> You know, as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, that within theſe few dayes, after two or three dayes, the time will come about wherein we celebrate the memoriall of his <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the time of his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> and this is another <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover,</hi> the Chriſtians <hi>Eaſter</hi> is his <hi>Paſſover:</hi> and if there were not this, yet the remembrance of that work, about which we are converſant this day. As Chriſt is the <hi>Paſſover</hi> in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the thing, ſo the <hi>Sacrament</hi> that he inſtituted, his laſt Supper, that is as the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:114893:234"/>in the memoriall of the benefite, it is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that came in the room of the other; the Lords Supper, that is the Chriſtians Paſſover alſo, and you know that thoſe dayes of receiving, they haſten upon you, the next <hi>Sabbaoth,</hi> the next <hi>Friday,</hi> this very day.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave then, to call upon you againe, that you will be pleaſed to make ready, to <hi>prepare</hi> your ſelves for thoſe times that are to come after, and to come with <hi>preparation.</hi> Now for this purpoſe I am ſent to you, and come to you at this time, as the Diſciples were ſent to the good man of the houſe, here it is the ſame word I bring to you, give me leave to aſke, <hi>where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi> It is the ſame Maſter of us <hi>all</hi> that hath ſent me to you, the <hi>good</hi> Maſter, the <hi>great</hi> Maſter, the <hi>very</hi> Maſter, that ſpeaks here in the Text, goe and prepare.</p>
                  <q>Say to the good man of the houſe, where is the Gueſt-Chamber, that I may eat the Paſſover with my Diſciples?</q>
                  <p>From Verſ. 14. to Verſ. 21. is ſet downe to us the <hi>manner</hi> of the celebration, the ſollemnizing, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſſover, and the celebrating of Chriſts laſt <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> From Verſ. 8. to Verſ. 14. is ſet downe the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> that was made for the keeping, and the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it. In Verſ. 13. there you have the preparation <hi>actuall.</hi> In the Verſe before, you have the <hi>directions</hi> for the preparation, and they are principally <hi>two.</hi> There is <hi>one</hi> direction that Chriſt gives them at their <hi>firſt</hi> entry into the <hi>Citty,</hi> they ſhall meet a man <hi>bearing a Pitcher of water.</hi> The other direction that Chriſt gives them, is when they ſhall enter into the <hi>Houſe,</hi> they ſhall then <hi>ſpeake to the good man of the houſe,</hi> and ſay <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>thus</hi> to him, that is in Verſ. 11. &amp; 12. So now, in theſe two
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:114893:234"/>Verſes I would intreat you to conſider onely theſe 3 things.</p>
                  <p>There is the <hi>perſon</hi> to whom Chriſt ſends them.</p>
                  <q>Say to the good man of the houſe.</q>
                  <p>And there is the <hi>Meſſage</hi> that they are to deliver to him, a forme of words that Chriſt preſcribes them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>The Maſter ſaith, where is the Gueſt-Chamber</l>
                     <l>That I may eat the Paſſover with my Diſciples?</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Then, the third is the <hi>Succeſſe,</hi> and the ſatisfaction that they ſhall receive upon this motion made to him.</p>
                  <q>He will ſhew you a large upper Roome furniſhed, there make ready.</q>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt, and that is the <hi>perſon</hi> to whome Chriſt ſends them; here it is in the Greek, the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the houſe, the Latine word is, the <hi>Father</hi> of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the Engliſh Tranſlation renders it oft in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <hi>the good man of the houſe.</hi> The Greek word that ſets downe to us moſt properly the civil reſpect, the <hi>Ruler</hi> of the Family; the Latine word ſets downe the <hi>naturall</hi> reſpect, the <hi>Father</hi> of the Family; the Engliſh ſets out beſt to us the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> reſpect, it is moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, it ſets downe the <hi>religious</hi> reſpect, the <hi>good man,</hi> that is, the <hi>chiefe,</hi> the <hi>beſt</hi> man in the houſe.</p>
                  <p>Four times in the Goſpell I find this word thus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>the good man of the houſe,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12. <hi>If the good man of the houſe</hi> (that is, the Maſter of the houſe) <hi>kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w at what houre the Thiefe would come.</hi> Likewiſe in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. where it is ſaid that thoſe that received the penny from
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:114893:235"/>the Lord, murmured; <hi>the Servants murmured against the good man of the houſe,</hi> againſt him that paid them, and here in this place I cannot but delight my ſelfe with the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> with the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the word, that they ſhould ſo happily light upon this word, which hath the <hi>propriety</hi> onely in our Engliſh tongue, as to Tranſlate the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the houſe, the <hi>good man</hi> of the houſe, the very interpretation of the word will ſhew us thus much: that
<q>Thoſe that are eminent in place, ſhould be eminent in piety.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be <hi>any</hi> piety, or <hi>goodneſſe</hi> to be found in a <hi>Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or in <hi>houſe,</hi> it is to be preſumed, that it is, or ſhould be in him that is the head, and chiefe; God expects it more at ſuch mens hands, by way of <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath given them <hi>more</hi> mercies, the whole is theirs, he expects it from them by way of <hi>duty,</hi> becauſe he hath given them a greater <hi>account,</hi> they are to anſwer, not for themſelues <hi>alone,</hi> but for <hi>others</hi> committed to their charge, they ſhould be <hi>examples</hi> of piety, they ſhould preſcribe it to others. Otherwiſe, if the <hi>great</hi> wheele be out of frame, it is much to be feared that the <hi>leſſer</hi> wheels wil not keep a regular motion. <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> uſually tread in the ſteps of thoſe <hi>Aeconomicall Kings,</hi> and it is a rare ſight to ſee, and to find a ſober <hi>Family,</hi> where the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the houſe is given to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling;</hi> or a Family that is <hi>chaſt,</hi> if the Maſter be <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> or a Family that is <hi>religious,</hi> if the Maſter or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe be <hi>prophane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore it will be your care Beloved, to uphold the word, and to continue to your ſelves, the comfort of this excellent interpretation, that ſtill the <hi>Maſter of the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:114893:235"/>houſe</hi> may reliſh the <hi>good man of the houſe.</hi> Indeed then goodneſſe came to be neglected, when man came to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>greatneſſe</hi> moſt; and it is the affectation of the words <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Lady,</hi> and Sir, that makes men ſo far to neglect <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and the name too of <hi>good man</hi> of the houſe.</p>
                  <p>But yet there is a way to preſerve it, if you be thoſe that governe your Servants <hi>righteouſly,</hi> that teach, and <hi>nurture</hi> your Children in the feare of the Lord, that ſet examples of piety to all. This name will ſtill be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, otherwiſe if you ſet <hi>evill</hi> examples to your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, if you read leſſons of <hi>luxury,</hi> never perſwade your ſelves, though you have the <hi>right,</hi> yet you looſe this <hi>name,</hi> it will be the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the houſe, but not the <hi>good man</hi> of the houſe; it will not be the <hi>good man,</hi> but the <hi>bad man</hi> of the houſe, when men ſpeake of you; that onely by the way.</p>
                  <p>We ſee what the name is whereby he is expreſt. There are two things that I meane to conſider in this point.</p>
                  <p>The name <hi>appellative</hi> that is expreſt, the <hi>good man of the houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His name <hi>proper</hi> that is concealed, his name is not ſet downe, onely the Diſciples are directed to the chiefe, goe to the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the Family; Chriſt tells not them, nor the Evangeliſt tells us, what the mans name was, none of all the Evangeliſts ſet it downe.</p>
                  <p>There are divers of the Ancients, that torture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very much, to find out <hi>who</hi> this man ſhould be, notwithſtanding that the Goſpell doth not ſet downe to us, neither his <hi>condition</hi> of life, or the <hi>place,</hi> or ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his houſe in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> nay, not ſo much as his name, who he was. Some there are, that would have it to be <hi>Simon</hi> the Leaper, he at whoſe houſe Chriſt but
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:114893:236"/>ſix dayes before, was entertained. But that is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for his houſe was at <hi>Bethanie,</hi> and this houſe was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they were ſent to. <hi>Nycephorus</hi> is very earneſt to have it to be the houſe of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, a houſe, ſayth he, that he changed with <hi>Cayphas</hi> the high Prieſt, for certaine other poſſeſſions that he had in <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> and this good man here ſpoken of, was his farmer, or <hi>Tenant,</hi> that kept the houſe at that time; to him they were ſent. A meere conjecture that hath no ground, or any circumſtance of a ground.</p>
                  <p>Of all other, the moſt probable that ſome gives, is that it was the houſe of <hi>Mark,</hi> the ſame houſe that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> came to, when he was delivered by the Angell, and there is this probability that indeed it ſeems to be the houſe of ſome <hi>clandeſtine</hi> Diſciple of Chriſt, ſome of thoſe that were well-affected to Chriſt, though there were ſome of his Diſciples that durſt not appeare to be ſo, becauſe of the people: we read of diverſe, <hi>John</hi> 12. ſuch as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Nychodemus,</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> and to this houſe they think theſe Diſciples were ſent; but yet it is probable, but no certainty; it is better to let goe theſe curioſities, and look to the reaſon. What ſhould be the reaſon that Chriſt doth not <hi>point</hi> out the <hi>name</hi> of this man to his Diſciples, nor the Evangeliſt to us.</p>
                  <p>In this other, the Fathers are as much different from one another, in giving the reaſons of the concealment of the name, as they are in other places very ſollicitous to find it out, and the reaſons are many that are given, why at this time Chriſt when he ſent his Diſciples, and the Evangeliſt when he recorded the ſtory, did not tell the name of the man.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gives this reaſon, his name is therefore concealed here, of purpoſe, ſayth he, to note that he was ſome meane <hi>obſcure</hi> man whom they had not knowne
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:114893:236"/>ever the better, if Chriſt had named him, he was of inferiour note, <hi>Ideo nomen non, &amp;c.</hi> ſayth <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his name is not aſſigned, that we may conceive him to be ſome ſuch man of <hi>inferior</hi> quality; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text will not beare this reaſon: the next Verſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, the ſecond Verſe of the Text, we ſee he <hi>provides,</hi> and makes ready a Roome <hi>large,</hi> and <hi>furniſhed,</hi> as the word in <hi>Mark</hi> will beare it, a Roome <hi>adorned,</hi> and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Hangings, and other good Furniture, that muſt not be ſuppoſed to be the Roome, or the houſe of a man of ſuch inferior note as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> would have it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hillarie</hi> gives this reaſon of the concealment of the name, becauſe (ſayth he) there was a new name to be given to all Beleivers after, therefore the notice of the old name is not taken of this man among other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he was to have the name of Chriſtian, <hi>Non dum Chriſtiani nominis,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith he, the honour of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an name was not yet impoſed upon Beleivers, and there was another name after to be added, therefore becauſe diverſe of them were to loſe their <hi>old</hi> name, it was to be ſwallowed up, and they were to be called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> therefore his name is not named; but this will not ſtand neither, for by the ſame reaſon none of all the Diſciples ſhould have beene named, for they were after pertakers of the name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yea, and the name of Apoſtles, and yet ever, and anon they are named.</p>
                  <p>There are others that think the reaſon of the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the name was, becauſe Chriſt would take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hereby to give them a teſtimony of his <hi>omniſcience,</hi> that he doth, by telling them of meeting a man with a Pitcher of water, and becauſe he meant to deſcribe the houſe after this faſhion, therefore he ſends them to a houſe in generall, that they ſhould not know whoſe houſe to enquire for, he tells them not the name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:114893:237"/>they ſhould goe upon that mark that Chriſt had given them; goe and you ſhall meet a man with a Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of water; this is very probable, but this gives not full ſatisfaction, becauſe if Chriſt had told the name of this mans houſe, it had been an argument of his omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience; notwithſtanding, becauſe he gave them ſuch a note and mark to know it by, that they ſhould meet that man with a Pitcher of water. Juſt ſuch a ſigne as <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet gave <hi>Saul</hi> when he departed from him, ſayth he, <hi>When thou art gone from me thou ſhalt meet in the plaine going up to Mount Tabor, three men with three Kids, and three loaves, and a Bottle of Wine.</hi> As he there by the ſpirit of Propheſie, did tell him what kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he ſhould meet, ſo Chriſt takes the ſame note and marke, whereby to deſcribe this mans houſe to them, therefore for all this he might have named him.</p>
                  <p>Others think the reaſon ſhould be, that no man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to note, that <hi>all</hi> men are invited to this <hi>new Paſſover,</hi> that Chriſt would keep, therefore no man is named; that is the reaſon of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> and others, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t omnis ſciant ſe, &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>all</hi> men might know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves invited to the communication of thoſe Myſteries. That this great ſolemnity of keeping the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and eſpecially of the inſtitution of Chriſts laſt <hi>Supper,</hi> might be made <hi>open,</hi> and plaine, and manifeſt to all, therefore to ſhew that <hi>all</hi> were invited, <hi>none</hi> was named, this is a good reaſon, but it is not <hi>textuall,</hi> it is not <hi>ſubſtantiall,</hi> for by the ſame argument then, there ſhould none of thoſe have been named that ſate <hi>downe</hi> with Chriſt, not he that leaned upon his boſome, none of thoſe that were his <hi>Auditors</hi> at any time, when he delivered the Myſteries of Salvation, the Myſteries of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the laſt place, others give this reaſon, that is the moſt proper, that therefore the man is not
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:114893:237"/>named, becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould not know which was the houſe where Chriſt kept the Paſſover, and ſo ſhould not prevent him by betraying him to the Phariſees, that is the reaſon that is given by <hi>Euthymius, Theophilact, Cyrill, Ne Judas traderet ante celebrationem paſchatis,</hi> ſayth <hi>Cyrill,</hi> leaſt <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould have betrayed him, peradventure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had celebrated the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and made all things ready, leaſt <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould have told the Phariſees. Now when <hi>Judas</hi> knew not the houſe, Chriſt that knew all things meant to prevent him, that though he had <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted</hi> with the Phariſees before to betray him, he could not tell the houſe till he came with Chriſt, and ſo could not betray him ſo ſoone. This is a moſt proper and probable reaſon, yet there may be two added to this, no leſſe probable, and profitable.</p>
                  <p>One is, the reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not name him to the <hi>Diſciples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the other, why the <hi>Evangelist</hi> doth not name him to <hi>us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why Chriſt did not name him to the Diſciples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was an unknowne Stranger, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon this reaſon, ſayth he, he was a man they knew not, it was all one if he had named him, and Chriſt could ſhew, that whoſoever he ſent to, ſhould condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, he had the ſway of his heart in his hand, and he would incline him to make him give that roome that he had provided for himſelfe. Chriſt would not onely ſhew his <hi>omniſcience,</hi> by telling them of a man that ſhould meet them with a Pitcher of water, but ſhew the greatneſſe of his <hi>power,</hi> that he ſent to a Stranger, and yet <hi>inclined</hi> his heart to make ready the roome, even in his abſence. It muſt needs be ſuppoſed, that if it had beene any of Chriſts <hi>Followers,</hi> if it had been any of his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> though of thoſe that were his <hi>ſecret</hi> Diſciples,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:114893:238"/>if it had been any of his <hi>Allies,</hi> or Acquaintance, in all likelihood the name would have been ſet downe to us, if not declared to the Diſciples. Chriſt that knew the houſe by his preſcience, knew the name. <hi>Sciebas domine Jeſu nomen. &amp;c.</hi> ſayth <hi>Ambroſe</hi> well, Lord, thou diddeſt know the name of the man, thou did'ſt <hi>conceale</hi> it from thy Diſciples, that they might <hi>know</hi> thee the better.</p>
                  <p>And then the ſecond is, why the Evangeliſt conceals it from us; that is upon ſpeciall reaſon, to teach us thus much, that we ſhould not ſpend our <hi>time</hi> about things <hi>circumſtantiall,</hi> that we ſhould not <hi>neglect</hi> the <hi>weighty</hi> matters of the Goſpell, that we ſhould not take up our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and beſtow our <hi>Studies</hi> ſo much on <hi>times,</hi> and <hi>perſons,</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> the knowledge whereof is not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, as the knowledge of the <hi>things</hi> that we ſhould labour to be excerciſed in, matters that are <hi>morall,</hi> in matters of <hi>faith,</hi> in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of thoſe things that <hi>ſanctifie</hi> the heart, and be directions to life; what will it profite me to know the names of the two Diſciples that were ſent to looſe the Colt, ſince I have their example of obedience, though I know not their names; what though I cannot tell who was the <hi>Woman</hi> that waſhed Chriſts Feet with her Tears, and wiped them with her haire, I may benefit no leſſe by the example of her peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. What if I cannot tell this mans name to whom theſe Diſciples were ſent, ſince I enjoy no leſſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his piety. It hath pleaſed the Spirit of God in wiſdome to conceale from us the <hi>names</hi> of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſome <hi>Books,</hi> both in the <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, the Pen-man of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Heberws</hi> is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowne, and diverſe Books in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, what is the reaſon? God will have us <hi>beleive</hi> his word, though we know not the <hi>Authors;</hi> it is not the word of the <hi>Pen-men,</hi> but of <hi>God,</hi> it is Written by the Spirit of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:114893:238"/>God, though we know not whoſe hand God guided, it is not a thing materiall to know who was the <hi>Author,</hi> but it is our happineſſe that we have the <hi>Books;</hi> what would I care much, though I had never knowne the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> (though I give all reverence to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of Chriſts Pen-men) ſo I have the example of <hi>Peters Repentance,</hi> let me get that, let me be one that treads in his ſteps, though I had never known him. What would it skill, or <hi>diſadvantage</hi> me, if I had never knowne the name of <hi>Job,</hi> if I had him but deſcribed, the man that dwelt in the Land of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z,</hi> ſo I reach to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his <hi>patience,</hi> he is like <hi>Job,</hi> not that knows his <hi>name,</hi> but imitates his <hi>vertues.</hi> Or what would it diſadvantage me if I had never knowne the name of the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſince we have his excellent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that are a light to our Feet?</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us not ſpend time in knowing <hi>perſons,</hi> eſpecially if they be concealed, the <hi>ſame</hi> wiſdome of God that <hi>reveales</hi> the names of men for our <hi>remembrance,</hi> and imitation, in ſome places to teach us to look to things that are uſefull, and not to the knowledge of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or <hi>names.</hi> So much of that, that is, the <hi>Perſon</hi> to whom they were ſent, conſidered according to his <hi>appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi> name that is ſet downe, <hi>the good man of the houſe,</hi> and according to his <hi>proper</hi> name that is concealed, and <hi>not</hi> ſet downe, that he was <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>James,</hi> or <hi>Mark,</hi> or the like, it is not ſet downe, to teach us to ſtudy the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of his <hi>vertue.</hi>

                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:114893:239"/>ſometimes, but they muſt firſt learne <hi>themſelves,</hi> ſayth <hi>Ambroſe</hi> well. They firſt receive from Chriſt their great Maſter, thoſe inſtructions that they may <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> and impart to others, but he is ſuch a Maſter as <hi>Teucheth,</hi> and <hi>Learneth</hi> not; it is he alone that teacheth <hi>all,</hi> and learneth of <hi>none,</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of God, therefore moſt properly the Maſter, becauſe of the <hi>latitude</hi> of his <hi>knowledge,</hi> becauſe of the latitude of his <hi>power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, it is a name of <hi>humility,</hi> that Chriſt he could not uſe any <hi>lower,</hi> but the <hi>Son of man,</hi> that is the name uſually he profeſſeth of himſelfe. <hi>The Son of man came to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> But this of <hi>Maſter</hi> is the loweſt of all the Titles of <hi>excellency</hi> that were given him, and now he was in a ſtate of <hi>humility,</hi> and therefore even that name he makes choyſe of. It is to expreſſe his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he is pleaſed to call himſelfe <hi>the Son of man:</hi> we never read in all the Goſpell that he called himſelfe directly <hi>the Son of God.</hi> He did heare the Confeſſion with joy, and delight, when it was made by <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> and Diſciples, but yet in the very ſame place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. he forbids them to tell the <hi>World, See yee tell no man that Jeſus is the Chriſt;</hi> that is, <hi>the Son of God.</hi> What was the reaſon?</p>
                  <p>Partly becauſe he would not have the faith thereof prejudiced after, till his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he would not have them <hi>Preach</hi> that Doctrine; after the Reſurrection they might Preach it ſafely, many would would be ſcandalized by his ſuffering if they had Preached it before.</p>
                  <p>Then, another reaſon was out of his great <hi>humility,</hi> as he was in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of humility, ſo he takes to himſelfe <hi>Titles</hi> of humility, <hi>the Son of man,</hi> ſtill the Son of <hi>man</hi> is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no more but this, as much as a <hi>man,</hi> for all men are
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:114893:240"/>the Sons of <hi>man,</hi> even <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe, that was the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of all, was the <hi>Son</hi> of man, becauſe he was man though he were not begotten of any, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all men may be ſo called, yet you ſhall find no man in Scripture cal'd ſo, but <hi>Chriſt;</hi> onely <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the Prophets. <hi>Ireneus</hi> obſerves, there are but two in <hi>both</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, I never meet with more, that is, <hi>Ezekiell</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Chriſt; Ezekiell</hi> is ſo called <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Son of man ſtand upon thy Feet.</hi> What is the reaſon he ſhould be called ſo? <hi>All men</hi> are ſo, and all the <hi>Prophets</hi> were ſo: But why <hi>Ezekiel</hi> more then the reſt, and he onely?</p>
                  <p>One reaſon may be, becauſe in his Viſions he was converſant among Angells, therefore to put him in mind that he ſhould not be tranſported above meaſure, as <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he ſhould not be elevated, <hi>a Meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him,</hi> to take him off leaſt he ſhould be puffed up with revelations: So the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is called the Son of man; though thou be in theſe Viſions remember thou art but <hi>man,</hi> the <hi>Sonne of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another reaſon why he is ſo called, may be, becauſe he of all other of the Prophets, had <hi>moſt</hi> Viſions, and it is the ſame reaſon why our bleſſed Saviour calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo; for he onely beſides <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and he oft is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. in the Old Teſtament, <hi>I ſaw one like the Son of man,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Incarnation.</hi> In the New Teſtament he calls himſelfe ſtill ſo, he never was called by any elſe but, <hi>Jeſus thou Son of David,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus thou Son of God,</hi> but he calls himſelfe <hi>the Son of man,</hi> out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of humility. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. he adds this clauſe when it ſeemed ſuperfluous, <hi>Whom doe you ſay that I the Son of man am?</hi> The ſence had been full if he had ſaid, whom doe you ſay that <hi>I am,</hi> yet he adds out of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, ſo great was his humility, <hi>Whom doe you ſay that I
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:114893:240"/>the Son of man, am?</hi> As he there calls himſelfe the <hi>Son of man,</hi> and in diverſe places, ſo here too out of abundance of humility, when he ſends to this Owner, the <hi>good man of the houſe,</hi> he ſayth, not the <hi>Lord,</hi> the Son of <hi>God</hi> ſayth, the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſſe,</hi> the Lord our <hi>Redeemer</hi> ſayth, but the <hi>Maſter</hi> ſayth.</p>
                  <p>That Obſervation of <hi>Jerome</hi> concerning the man that came to Chriſt, and would have followed him. <hi>Maſter I will follow thee where ever thou goeſt,</hi> and Chriſt would not ſuffer him. <hi>Jerome</hi> obſerves, that the reaſon why he repelled him, was, becauſe he called him <hi>Maſter,</hi> if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord</hi> I will follow thee, he had not had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe: that Obſervation I ſay will not hold, for Chriſt himſelfe that gives direction to call him <hi>Maſter,</hi> and <hi>now</hi> to call him Maſter when they were to goe on ſuch a Meſſage as ſhewed his <hi>Authority,</hi> ſhews plainly that Chriſt did not ſtomack it, he was not <hi>offended</hi> that any man ſhould call him <hi>Maſter,</hi> nay, he delighted in the name: as the name of <hi>Lord</hi> ſets out his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> ſo the name of <hi>Master</hi> ſhews that he is the onely chiefe <hi>Teacher,</hi> even he himſelfe when he ſent to this man he bids them uſe the name, <hi>the Maſter ſayth,</hi> it was moſt fit in regard of <hi>himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it was a moſt fit name in reſpect of the <hi>man</hi> that was to receive the Meſſage.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it was the fitteſt name for the Triall of his <hi>faith,</hi> it is not ſaid, <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſayth, then he muſt needs condiſcend, for who will not ſet <hi>open</hi> his houſe that <hi>Jeſus</hi> may come there? But Chriſt will have him <hi>give</hi> a teſtimony of his <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>Maſter</hi> ſaith, ſome men would have asked pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, who is the <hi>Maſter?</hi> No, but as ſoon as he hears the name <hi>Maſter,</hi> he knew they meant <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there he gave a teſtimony of his knowledge, and faith?</p>
                  <p>Then, it was the fitteſt name for <hi>comfort;</hi> Chriſt by
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:114893:241"/>this adopts his Diſciples, they ſay, not <hi>our Maſter,</hi> though he was ſo, but <hi>the Maſter, the</hi> Lord, <hi>the</hi> great Maſter, he that will be <hi>thy</hi> Maſter if thou wilt receive him, and welcome him, he renders thee this <hi>priviledge,</hi> that thou mayſt be his <hi>Diſciple,</hi> it is <hi>the</hi> Maſter ſayth, it was for the teſtimony of his <hi>faith,</hi> and fitteſt for his <hi>comfort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it was the moſt fit name to <hi>perſwade</hi> him to this thing, for it is a name that hath a great deale of <hi>force,</hi> and power in it: when the two Diſciples went to loſe the <hi>Colt,</hi> on which Chriſt was to Ride to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Owner aſked them why they looſed him? All the anſwer they gave, was this, the Lord, or <hi>Master hath need of him,</hi> as ſoone as ever they heard this word, it was ſuch a <hi>convincing</hi> word that they parted preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that which was their <hi>owne,</hi> and ſuffered him to be carried away. When <hi>Mary</hi> was in the middeſt of her dumps, they were grieved for the death of their Brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as ſoone as ſhee heard <hi>Martha</hi> come and tell her <hi>the Maſter is come,</hi> it put her out of her ſorrow, preſently ſhee <hi>aroſe,</hi> there was ſo much comfort in the word, that ſhee thought all <hi>comfort</hi> was come, and all <hi>ſorrow</hi> was <hi>forgotten,</hi> when ſhee heard that name, becauſe it is ſo <hi>powerfull,</hi> and <hi>perſwaſive</hi> a word in the hearts of all that know Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it was the fitteſt name that <hi>they</hi> could carry, becauſe they were <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and Chriſt would ſhew them by this how much <hi>obedience</hi> he found even in thoſe that were <hi>not</hi> Diſciples, and he would ſhew them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, how they were to goe into the World to <hi>Preach</hi> the Goſpell, in <hi>whoſe</hi> name, they were not to goe in their owne name. Did we Baptiſe in our <hi>owne name,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle, or did we preach in our owne name? No, the Prophets did not ſo, but they came, <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord.</hi> Chriſt <hi>himſelfe</hi> as <hi>Mediator,</hi> he came not in his <hi>owne</hi>
                     <pb n="447" facs="tcp:114893:241"/>name, therefore <hi>bleſſed</hi> (ſay the People) <hi>is he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the name of the Lord.</hi> Looke, ſayth <hi>Auſtin,</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoever he is that commeth in his <hi>owne</hi> name, he is curſed, as every man is that brings his <hi>owne</hi> Dreames, and inventions, and leaves the word of <hi>God;</hi> he comes in his <hi>owne</hi> name. The Diſciples did not, they came in <hi>Chriſts</hi> name, <hi>Nun quid, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> tell me when <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> preached the Goſpell, did they uſe their <hi>owne</hi> words, did they not ſpeake ſo, as <hi>inſpired,</hi> and guided by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God? So they ſaid as Chriſt their Maſter ſaid to them, to teach us thus much, that it was not by their <hi>owne</hi> words, but by the word, and <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Gods grace powred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it was not <hi>them,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> that converted by their Preaching, whoſe word they preached.</p>
                  <p>Is it not ſo with us now? Though we be as <hi>Earthen,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> earthen veſſells that ſpeake to you now, as earthen as ever, and as <hi>weake,</hi> yet in whoſe name come we? Be the <hi>inſtruments</hi> never ſo <hi>meane,</hi> of the <hi>loweſt,</hi> and moſt <hi>inferior</hi> note, yet there is that that adds <hi>Majeſty</hi> to our word, we ſpeake from God, we come from the great <hi>Maſter,</hi> when we preſſe upon you any Doctrine of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi> doe we preſſe the Exhortation from our ſelves? When we diſcover to you any <hi>ſin</hi> that you ſhould <hi>leave,</hi> and forſake, is it that <hi>we</hi> call it <hi>ſin,</hi> or that the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls <hi>ſin?</hi> When we intreat you to give us your <hi>attention,</hi> doe we intreat you to liſten to <hi>us?</hi> No, if any man come in his <hi>owne</hi> name, let him have your neglect, ſtop your eares, let him be curſed, but if we come in the name of Chriſt, in the name of the <hi>great</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in the name of <hi>God;</hi> if we tell you it is he your <hi>Redeemer,</hi> your <hi>Saviour,</hi> it is he that ſpeaks, it is the Lord your <hi>Judge,</hi> it is the Lord your <hi>Maſter.</hi> O who will
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:114893:242"/>not melt at the hearing of this name, <hi>The Maſter ſayth,</hi> it is the word that includes in it all <hi>comfort,</hi> he that can alone <hi>teach</hi> by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> he from whom you expect <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> whatſoever this <hi>Booke ſpeaks,</hi> whatſoever it ſaith, <hi>he</hi> ſayth, becauſe it was penned by this <hi>Spirit,</hi> it is the <hi>Maſter</hi> that ſayth it, that is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>Though I would have you withall, remember that it is not the <hi>Maſter beſeecheth,</hi> but the Maſter <hi>ſayth,</hi> that is, the Maſter <hi>

                  <p>The next is the <hi>enquiry</hi> after the place they are to provide, <hi>Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this we may obſerve theſe <hi>two</hi> things, it ſets out to us two things that are <hi>contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See here both the <hi>Poverty,</hi> &amp; <hi>Plenty</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It ſets out to us, firſt his <hi>Poverty,</hi> he was one that ſtood in need of a <hi>Lodging</hi> to keep the Paſſover, he had no <hi>Houſe,</hi> nay not ſo much as a <hi>Chamber,</hi> nay, neyther <hi>he,</hi> nor his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> for if any of his Diſciples had had a <hi>houſe,</hi> or a <hi>Chamber,</hi> it is very likely the Paſſover ſhould have beene kept at <hi>that</hi> houſe, and his laſt <hi>Supper</hi> ſhould
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:114893:242"/>there have been inſtituted, the word ſignifies an <hi>Inn;</hi> it is ſo called, becauſe men commonly when they have done their buſineſſe, and have baited ſufficiently, they <hi>looſe</hi> from ſuch a place to another, they doe not abide in the place, there is a <hi>departure,</hi> a <hi>looſing,</hi> a <hi>going</hi> away, nay more, it doth not onely ſignifie the <hi>whole</hi> houſe, but any <hi>Roome</hi> that is <hi>hired,</hi> or taken up, or <hi>marked</hi> out; Chriſt had not a <hi>Roome,</hi> not a <hi>Chamber</hi> of his <hi>owne</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> no not for duties of <hi>piety,</hi> he was faine to goe, and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat</hi> for one, he ſends his Diſciples to provide one.

                  <p>Let the men of the <hi>World</hi> heare this, that build to themſelves <hi>ſtately</hi> Pallaces upon <hi>Earth,</hi> that deſire to be kept <hi>ſtately,</hi> to lie <hi>ſoftly,</hi> thoſe whoſe delight is as the Prophet ſpeaks, to build <hi>faire</hi> Houſes, and ſtrong for themſelves, and think they have made themſelves a <hi>name,</hi> thoſe that dote ſo much upon the <hi>World,</hi> that they build ſo as if they were to live for <hi>eternity,</hi> is that an argument in us that we are men <hi>mortified</hi> to the world? If our affections run that way onely after ſtately <hi>Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or doe we think hereby we conforme our ſelves to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Though there is a <hi>Liberty</hi> that we may take,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:114893:243"/>yet if we come to ſet our hearts upon ſuch things, doe we not think that they will draw ſo much of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, let them heare this that have <hi>no</hi> Houſe to put their head in; here is <hi>comfort</hi> for them, though they want a <hi>Habitation,</hi> yet they want not <hi>conformity</hi> to Chriſt: it is ſo oft times now in the World, that Chriſt in his Members wants <hi>Lodging,</hi> they want a place to Lodge in, I will ceaſe to wonder at it, if ever I live to ſee it, as we may ſee it too oft, the Saints of God wandring abroad <hi>deſtitute, afflicted, tormented,</hi> driven to live in <hi>Caves</hi> of the Earth, in Dens, and Deſerts, and Woods, and ſecret places, that they may hide themſelves from the perſecuting of Enemies, as now in thoſe parts of the Church beyond the Seas, I will ceaſe to wonder, ſeeing that Chriſt their head, and Chriſt their <hi>Redeemer,</hi> the Lord of our Salvation, even he himſelfe that was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of all things, he would not take to himſelfe the title of any <hi>houſe,</hi> when he was below, but was faine to <hi>borrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If ever it ſhall be my <hi>owne</hi> condition, or <hi>yours,</hi> I cannot tell, yet let us ceaſe to repine, and <hi>murmure,</hi> and grudge at Gods providence, would we not be willing to tread in that <hi>Path,</hi> and to tread it out, and walk to the <hi>end,</hi> that Chriſt hath ſet to us in his owne perſon? The condition of diverſe of the <hi>beſt</hi> Saints of God, hath been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chriſt himſelfe, therefore this ſhall be <hi>my</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, and comfort, though we miſſe a <hi>Lodging</hi> on Earth, he that cannot get a <hi>grave</hi> in <hi>Earth,</hi> as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> we read not that he had any, yet he found a <hi>Manſion</hi> of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Heaven, a <hi>Boſome</hi> prepared for him, <hi>Abrahams bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> though we be thruſt out of all mens Doors here, yet God will ſet that <hi>open,</hi> if we be of the number of thoſe that <hi>beleive</hi> in his name, and <hi>walke</hi> in the wayes of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:114893:243"/>his <hi>Commandements,</hi> the path that he hath ſet to us, there muſt be our comfort, not to be aſhamed of a <hi>low</hi> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Chriſt ſtooped to it, he had not ſo much of his <hi>owne</hi> poſſeſſion, as to call <hi>one</hi> Chamber his, to ſet out his <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But withall it ſets out the <hi>plenty</hi> of Chriſt, for though a man have <hi>nothing</hi> in <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> yet if he have much in <hi>title,</hi> he is rich, Chriſt had nothing of his <hi>owne;</hi> the whole <hi>World,</hi> and every mans <hi>houſe,</hi> that Houſe is his, that he would Command, and <hi>marke</hi> out for himſelfe, <hi>Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi> A man would have thought that Chriſt ſpake not of his owne, there is a <hi>houſe</hi> that <hi>I</hi> have in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I have pointed out <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Roome</hi> to eat my Paſſover with my Diſciples, he ſayth not, tell us if thou haſt a Gueſt-Chamber, or we intreat <hi>thee</hi> that we may have it by way of <hi>hire,</hi> and we will give thee ſo much as it is worth for the time, or ſeaſon; <hi>lend</hi> it our Maſter for a while, this is his ſuite, and this is ours; no, but to ſhew that Chriſt had right to it, <hi>Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi> I have a Chamber in <hi>thy</hi> houſe that thou calleſt <hi>thine,</hi> If I marke, and ſet it a part, it is not <hi>thine,</hi> now where is the Gueſt-Chamber that I have <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> out?</p>
                  <p>It tells us thus much, that God hath more <hi>intereſt</hi> in that that is ours, then we our ſelves; if he call for it, he <hi>hath</hi> intereſt in every mans poſſeſſion, the men of the Citty acknowledged ſo much when they let the <hi>Colt</hi> goe, at that word, <hi>The Lord hath need of him,</hi> ſo this man acknowledged as much when he let his <hi>Chamber</hi> goe at the word of Chriſt, <hi>Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will be a great meanes to incline us (Beloved) to the <hi>right</hi> uſe of thoſe things that God hath truſted us with, if we doe but acknowledge that <hi>hand</hi> from whence they come, if we can but acknowledge who is

                  <p>It will be a great meanes to <hi>ſtabliſh,</hi> and comfort our hearts, when God takes <hi>away</hi> that plenty that he hath given us, he takes away his <hi>owne,</hi> ſo long he hath truſted me with the diſpenſing of it, he hath made me his <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> he will ſee if I will ſerve him in a <hi>lower</hi> condition, may I not truſt him with his <hi>owne?</hi>

                  <p>It will be a great excitement to <hi>charity,</hi> when God preſents the poore to us, <hi>God</hi> Commands and aſks, <hi>Chriſt</hi> begs with his mouth, he holds out his <hi>hand,</hi> he aſks, what? any thing that is <hi>mine?</hi> No, for his <hi>owne.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſhewed plainly, thoſe that have <hi>Houſes</hi> ſhould be as if they had <hi>none,</hi> and thoſe that have <hi>Wives</hi> ſhould be as if they had <hi>none.</hi> How is this that ſuch as have married Wives ſhould be as if they had none? Becauſe the Church is the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of Chriſt, Chriſt is the <hi>Husband,</hi> and in regard of <hi>that</hi> Marriage, the other is not to be <hi>owned;</hi> and thoſe that have <hi>Maſters,</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> ſhould be as if they had <hi>none,</hi> becauſe <hi>one is our Maſter in Heaven,</hi> and thoſe that have <hi>Houſes</hi> as if they had none, becauſe our Lot, and portion is <hi>above,</hi> and <hi>thoſe that uſe the World, as not uſing it,</hi> becauſe whatſoever is in the World, it is nothing to the poſſeſſion that God hath provided for us. If we could but once come to

Chriſt ſpeaks oft in his word, though we heare not when he calls, <hi>Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi> He ſpeaks to us this word, when he tenders a miſerable <hi>Spectacle,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it before our eyes in a <hi>poore</hi> creature that wants the neceſſaries of this life; many Saints of God there are that are <hi>Harbourleſſe,</hi> they come, and in them <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks, where is the <hi>Lodging</hi> thou haſt provided for this poore man, I meane to ſend him to <hi>Lodge</hi> with thee this night; they have received <hi>Angells,</hi> nay <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe in them, Oh, <hi>Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi> It is that that Chriſt ſpeaks to the <hi>impropriator,</hi> and <hi>depopulator,</hi> not onely of the houſes of <hi>men,</hi> but of the houſe of <hi>God, Where is the Gueſt-Chamber</hi> where my people ſhould meet together to call upon my name, and to be <hi>inſtructed</hi> in the wayes of Salvation?

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:114893:245"/>Gueſt-Chamber is the Church of God, the Furniture of that is <hi>Devotion,</hi> the ſecond Gueſt-Chamber is the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, the <hi>Furniture</hi> of that is <hi>repentance;</hi> the third Gueſt-Chamber is the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>Furniture</hi> of that is the <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>reformation</hi> of thoſe that <hi>beleive</hi> in his name.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the courſe of our bleſſed Saviour in the Goſpell upon ſome ſolemn occaſions to ſend forth his Diſciples, as <hi>Noah</hi> did the Creatures into the Ark, by <hi>pairs,</hi> two, and two. <hi>Two</hi> Diſciples he ſent to looſe the <hi>Colt,</hi> that he rod on in Tryumph to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. Two</hi> Diſciples he ſent here for the preparing of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> when he meant to keep the <hi>laſt,</hi> and moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne.
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:114893:246"/>And he did it upon ſpeciall reaſon. Partly for the <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>imployment.</hi> Partly for the <hi>comfort</hi> of the <hi>Meſſengers.</hi> Partly for the <hi>expedition</hi> of the work. The looſing of the <hi>Colt</hi> was a matter of <hi>hazzard,</hi> and trouble; the preparing of the <hi>Paſſover</hi> was a matter of <hi>paines,</hi> and labour, he ſends them therefore <hi>two.</hi> And he doth not ſend them at all adventure, but he gives them a mark that was infallible for their better guidance, they ſhould <hi>meet a man bearing a Pitcher of water.</hi> It is eyther my <hi>happineſſe,</hi> or <hi>unhappineſſe,</hi> Beloved, that the <hi>imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is the <hi>ſame,</hi> and the <hi>aſſiſtance leſſe.</hi> The end of our <hi>Preaching</hi> is the looſing of the <hi>Colt,</hi> and yet not the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but the <hi>breaking</hi> of Creatures that are <hi>more</hi> unruly. And the end of <hi>this</hi> Sermon is a <hi>preparation,</hi> but not of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> but of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> a Sacrament <hi>more</hi> honourable in it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> and more <hi>comfortable</hi> in the <hi>fruit;</hi> therefore that which ſtands in need of a great many <hi>more</hi> Diſciples. The <hi>work</hi> is the ſame, or the like; you ſee the <hi>ability leſſe.</hi> I am to come to you to ſpeak alone, there is no Diſciple to be my <hi>Aſſiſtant;</hi> and I want that <hi>guidance</hi> too that thoſe two Diſciples had. I ſhould look long before I ſhould ſpie a man with a <hi>Pitcher</hi> of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>It may be obſerved in Scripture, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fortunate, and <hi>ſucceſsfull</hi> journeys that had ſuch guidances. <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant, when he went to chooſe a Wife for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that was his happineſſe that God guided him to meet <hi>Rebecka</hi> with a <hi>Pitcher</hi> of water. <hi>Saul</hi> when he went to inquire for <hi>Samuel,</hi> that was his happineſſe, he met a <hi>Woman</hi> that was about the ſame imployment, and ſhee told him where the Prophet was. Our bleſſed Saviour himſelfe <hi>John</hi> 4. was ſure of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> when he met the woman at the <hi>well.</hi> It is that that I would faine doe, but it will be long ere I ſhall find ſuch
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:114893:246"/>a happy guidance. If I could find but one man who had a <hi>Pitcher</hi> of water, I would preſently find out the <hi>Gueſt-Chamber.</hi> It is not the <hi>Pitcher,</hi> but the <hi>

                        </gap>ountaine</hi> of water, the Teares of <hi>repentance,</hi> that are the preparative for that performance; that was that which Chriſt ſought, that was that which the Diſciples met with, that is the thing I ſhall deſire to find here, for my guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the proſecution of this Scripture. It muſt be <hi>mine</hi> to ſeek, but <hi>yours</hi> to give: whereſoever there is ſuch a <hi>Pitcher</hi> of water in the <hi>eye,</hi> there is the <hi>Gueſt-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> in the <hi>heart;</hi> and where the Chamber is ſo <hi>furniſhed,</hi> there Chriſt will come to feaſt, to eat, not the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> not with his Diſciples, but with his <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoul,</hi> not himſelfe to <hi>eat,</hi> but to <hi>give</hi> us to feed, and that of his <hi>grace,</hi> and of his <hi>goodneſſe.</hi> It is the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Scripture, it is the intendment of my weak meditations at this time. Wherein I ſhall fit you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to goe on, if we look firſt a little what we have done already.</p>
                  <p>I told you this Scripture conteins in it theſe 3 things.</p>
                  <p>There is the <hi>perſon</hi> to whom they were ſent, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed here, in that he is <hi>not deſcribed.</hi> Two things were obſervable in him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>apellative</hi> name which is ſet downe, <hi>The good man of the Houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>proper</hi> name which is concealed.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond it is the <hi>Meſſage</hi> which they are to carry here, theſe two Diſciples, when they are to prepare for the Paſſover. In that there are three things.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſtrength</hi> of their <hi>Commiſſion, The Maſter ſayth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is the <hi>enquiry</hi> of the <hi>place, Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is the <hi>deputation</hi> of it to a peculiar end, <hi>That I may eat the Paſſover with my Diſciples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:114893:247"/>
                  <p>Of the two firſt of theſe I have ſpoken already, I ſhewed <hi>who</hi> this <hi>good man</hi> of the houſe was, as far as it concernes us to know him. What was the reaſon why this terme was ſet before the Commiſſion, <hi>The Maſter ſayth,</hi> not the <hi>Lord</hi> ſayth, not <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> ſayth. It was the fitteſt name for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to give them, it was the fitteſt for <hi>them</hi> to carry, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itteſt for the <hi>good man</hi> of the houſe to receive.</p>
                  <p>I ſpake of the inquiry after the place. <hi>Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi> How Chriſt had none of his <hi>owne,</hi> he had no <hi>Houſe,</hi> nor <hi>Chamber</hi> to Lodg in, not ſo much as to keep the <hi>Paſſover.</hi> He had no houſe for <hi>civill,</hi> no houſe for <hi>religious</hi> affairs.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it ſhews his plenty, that he that had none of his <hi>owne,</hi> could Command all, that was <hi>this</hi> mans, that was not <hi>knowne</hi> to the Diſciples, nor knowne further to <hi>him,</hi> then his <hi>divine</hi> nature found him out. Thus far I went in the Fore-noone.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>third</hi> thing in the <hi>ſecond</hi> generall, is the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> of this Gueſt-Chamber that they were thus to enquire after, to a <hi>holy,</hi> and religious purpoſe.</p>
                  <q>Where I ſhall eat the Paſſover with my Diſciples.</q>
                  <p>In that you ſee theſe <hi>two</hi> things propounded to us.</p>
                  <p>There is the <hi>end</hi> to which it is deputed, <hi>That I may eat the Paſſover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>Communicants, With my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt, it is the <hi>end</hi> for which it is <hi>deputed,</hi> for the <hi>eating</hi> of the <hi>Paſſover.</hi> It was <hi>one</hi> end, but not the <hi>ſole</hi> end, it was not the <hi>chiefe</hi> end; there was a <hi>greater</hi> end that Chriſt mentions not, that was the celebration of that <hi>laſt Supper</hi> of his, the <hi>firſt</hi> to him, his <hi>laſt</hi> to us. But
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:114893:247"/>he makes mention here onely of eating of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> becauſe that onely was <hi>knowne</hi> both to the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and to the <hi>Jews.</hi> In that we may ſee that of the Apoſtle fulfilled, it was accompliſhed here. <hi>Love</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is the fullfilling of the Law.</hi> Therefore love is the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law, becauſe Chriſt is the fullfilling of the Law. <hi>God is love,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt is love,</hi> and Chriſt is onely the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the Law, and the <hi>fullfiller</hi> of it. We ſhall not neede to ſtand much upon that particuler, to look to the reaſons why Chriſt would condiſcend to eat the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> as he ſaith in the Goſpell, <hi>Then are the Children free.</hi> He ſaid it of <hi>Tribute,</hi> it is true<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of <hi>theſe</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities that are religious, then is the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelfe free. Chriſt was the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> Chriſt was the <hi>Inſtitutor</hi> of the Paſſover, will he pleaſe to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate? It is true indeed, in <hi>himſelfe</hi> he was <hi>exempted,</hi> and needed not doe it, but he did it for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the <hi>honouring</hi> of his <hi>owne</hi> Ordinance, it was he that appointed that Sacrament, by the diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Jews, to the people of Iſraell, therefore to ſhew that he was a <hi>countenancer</hi> of his <hi>owne</hi> inſtitution, he was pleaſed himſelfe to eat of it. As he was the Son of <hi>God,</hi> ſo he was <hi>not</hi> at all, nor could not be <hi>ſubject;</hi> and as he was the Son of <hi>man,</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>righteous</hi> man, therefore he was <hi>free.</hi> He could have freed himſelfe from thoſe <hi>afflictions,</hi> the deliverance whereof the <hi>Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> ſignified; and he could have made himſelfe free from all that <hi>injury</hi> that was offered him by the Jews, yet he was pleaſed to <hi>condiſcend</hi> ſo far, ſayth St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> well, it was thus far appointed, he that inſtituted the Paſſover, taking the <hi>ſimilitude of fleſh,</hi> yet <hi>true</hi> fleſh, being incarnate, that he himſelfe ſhould obſerve that rite that <hi>himſelfe</hi> inſtituted. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> preſſeth it well, that is the part of a good <hi>Paſtor,</hi> or <hi>Shepheard,</hi> to goe before his
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:114893:248"/>Sheep in his owne <hi>example,</hi> and <hi>himſelfe</hi> to doe that that he would have <hi>them</hi> to doe. That he might make us <hi>zealous</hi> in all thoſe performances that he requires at our hands, he himſelfe was pleaſed to <hi>performe,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend to the performance of that that concerned him <hi>not,</hi> to eat the <hi>Paſſover.</hi> That is the firſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another reaſon was, the preparative of his owne <hi>Paſſion,</hi> he ſaw that his owne ſufferings drew nigh, the <hi>Paſſover</hi> it ſelfe was a <hi>Type</hi> of that, to ſhew, that he was the <hi>true</hi> Paſſover, he brings into the <hi>ſame</hi> Room, the Paſſover that was the <hi>Type,</hi> and the Paſſover that was the <hi>Truth.</hi> As St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves well, at the ſame Table, there was both the <hi>one</hi> Paſſover, that was the <hi>figure,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> that was the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates <hi>both.</hi> The keeping of the Paſſover, was nothing elſe to the Children of Iſrael, but a remembrance of that grace that was <hi>paſt,</hi> and a ſealing of ſome other grace that was <hi>promiſed.</hi> The grace that was <hi>paſt,</hi> was the goodneſſe of God in making the Angell to <hi>paſſe-over</hi> them when he ſmote the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> here then was the conformity, <hi>Diem tranſitus, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt when he was to <hi>paſse</hi> from death to life, he keeps that Feaſt that was the ſolemnity of that great tranſciſion, that God wrought for them: and being to taſt of the bitterneſſe of <hi>death,</hi> he would goe in the eating of the <hi>ſoure</hi> Herbs, to the drinking of that <hi>ſourer</hi> Cup of his Paſſion. To ſhew thereby, that he was the <hi>end</hi> of all the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Law, the end of all the <hi>Types</hi> in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament: that very <hi>Lamb</hi> which was the moſt eminent of the Types, was now fulfilled in the appearance and <hi>preſence</hi> of Chriſt, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayth, <hi>Sanguis ille, &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>Lamb</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified <hi>Chriſt, the Lamb of God;</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> of that Lamb that was then ſprinkled upon the Poſts of the Door, ſignified, that far more <hi>precious</hi> blood of Chriſt
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:114893:248"/>that was ſhed for the waſhing away of ſin. That is the ſecond reaſon, that he might Preach to them by this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſhew who was the Meſſias, the <hi>true</hi> Lamb, the <hi>true</hi> Paſſover, as the Apoſtle calls him, <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover is Sacrificed for us.</hi> Therefore Chriſt did eat the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it was alſo for the <hi>abrogation</hi> of it, to put an <hi>end</hi> to it. He put an end to <hi>Circumciſion</hi> virtually by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, as he gave ſtrength to <hi>Baptiſme</hi> by aſſuming it; by joyning theſe two <hi>Sacraments, legall,</hi> and <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and the <hi>Supper;</hi> he put an end to the <hi>one,</hi> and gave <hi>ſtrength</hi> of beginning to the <hi>other.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that <hi>Euthimius</hi> obſerves, that in the celebration of the Paſſover, he keeps it not exactly, as it was preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the <hi>Jews.</hi> It was ſet them the 14. day, and he kept it the 13. day. They were to eat it <hi>ſtanding,</hi> he eat the Paſſover <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>leaning.</hi> One reaſon why he kept it the 13. day was, becauſe he would not be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> in his Paſſion. He knew the 14. day that it ſhould be kept, was the day of his deliverance, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying;</hi> therefore to make an end of that work, that was one reaſon he kept it ſooner, and diſpenſed with his owne Law.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon was to ſhew (in the <hi>different</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it) that the <hi>Paſſover</hi> was <hi>aboliſhed;</hi> all judaicall <hi>ſhaddowes</hi> began to vaniſh; now they were <hi>dead,</hi> though their death did not appeare till <hi>afterward.</hi> The Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was an <hi>obſcure</hi> Type, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſpeaks well, of a <hi>clearer</hi> Type, the repreſentation of the Lords <hi>Supper;</hi> and therefore was to give way to the better, and more honourable Sacrament that then Chriſt inſtituted, by <hi>joyning</hi> it to the former, ſayth <hi>Theophilact,</hi> there was <hi>blood</hi> that was taken away by <hi>blood, ceremoniall</hi> blood by the blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There was a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that was taken
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:114893:249"/>away by a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> the <hi>legall</hi> Sacrifice by the <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſover</hi> it ſelfe, even while it was <hi>fullfilled,</hi> it was <hi>changed;</hi> that was another reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The third reaſon, therefore Chriſt eat the <hi>Paſſover</hi> that he might put an <hi>end</hi> to it, and make it the <hi>laſt</hi> eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, the reaſon why he eat i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and kept it, was, to ſhew his <hi>ſubjection</hi> to the Law, to ſet us a <hi>patterne</hi> and example of obedience, he was obedient in every point, not onely to the Law <hi>morall,</hi> but even the Law <hi>ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> For two reaſons.</p>
                  <p>One was, <hi>he</hi> became <hi>obedient,</hi> becauſe we were <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> that his obedience might ſatisfie for our neglect. We were <hi>tranſgreſſors</hi> of the law, Chriſt would be a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it. Sayth St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> becauſe thou wert a <hi>Tranſgreſſor</hi> of the Law, therefore Chriſt was pleaſed to <hi>keep</hi> it; <hi>he</hi> was made a curſe to <hi>free</hi> us from the curſe; <hi>he</hi> was made <hi>ſin</hi> to waſh away <hi>our ſins.</hi> He was made <hi>under</hi> the Law <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. that he might <hi>free</hi> us, that his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> might ſatisfie for our <hi>infirmities.</hi> And that here now the Chriſtians ſoule might find true refuge; for however I be <hi>aſſured</hi> that my ſins, and tranſgreſſions be waſhed away by the blood of Chriſt, yet when it comes to my <hi>particular:</hi> God requires <hi>perfect</hi> ſatisfaction to the <hi>whole</hi> Law, that I can <hi>never</hi> doe in my <hi>owne</hi> perſon; here is our refuge, there is <hi>one</hi> in our nature that hath <hi>ſatisfied</hi> the Law, and all that God could require, the very <hi>extreamity,</hi> and utmoſt letter, and <hi>period,</hi> that is Chriſt; and in that he is <hi>my</hi> Mediator, and Redeemer, I have done that that <hi>he</hi> did. <hi>I</hi> have done it in <hi>him,</hi> though I could not in my <hi>ſelfe.</hi> That he might perfectly <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi> and obey for <hi>us,</hi> he was <hi>obedient</hi> to the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to <hi>ſtop</hi> the mouths of all <hi>cavilling Phariſees,</hi> they were ready to object to him that he was a raiſer of
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:114893:249"/>
                     <hi>new</hi> Sects, that he was an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that therefore he came not from <hi>God.</hi> No, he ſhews in <hi>all</hi> the paſſages of his life, that he was one that <hi>honoured</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>conformable</hi> to it; the Law of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> he ſubſcribed to it: the Law of <hi>Dedication,</hi> and Offering in the Temple, he ſubſcribed to that: the Law of keeping the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> he ſubſcribed to that.</p>
                  <p>Let now <hi>prophane</hi> Wretches goe, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eaſed of the yoak of the <hi>Law</hi> of God, in that they are called to <hi>Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> Let men that know not the comfort of receiving the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that is <hi>divine,</hi> of Gods inſtitution, ſequeſter themſelves, and think it is no <hi>comfort,</hi> or benefite at all, to come to the <hi>Lords Table.</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour by this very example, did lay before their eyes, their owne refutation; that if he who was not <hi>tyed</hi> to the Law, yet would pleaſe to <hi>condiſcend</hi> ſo far, he that had <hi>power</hi> of the Law, he that was the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyner</hi> of the Paſſover, he that appointed it, if he would <hi>ſtoop</hi> ſo far that needed not to keep it, how much more ought <hi>we</hi> to conforme to all the precepts that God gives us, that ſo oft <hi>tranſgreſſe?</hi> We that ſtand in need of ſo <hi>many</hi> helps of <hi>faith,</hi> and increaſe of <hi>comfort,</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with ſo many <hi>temptations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, if we will have <hi>true</hi> comfort, let us find it in applying our whole lives to the <hi>obedience</hi> of Chriſt, to <hi>all</hi> thoſe precepts that God hath given us. If Chriſt were ſo <hi>ſtrict</hi> as even then when he <hi>aboliſhed</hi> the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>keep</hi> it; we that expect ſo much comfort as we need, had need be ſtirred up to come to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> oft: that is the reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is, the <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi> that I may eate the Paſſover.</p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:114893:250"/>
                  <q>With my Diſciples</q>
                  <p>He doth not name himſelfe <hi>alone,</hi> though indeed the proper worke of the Diſciples was not to be ſilent, yet he might have left them out: for it muſt be ſuppoſed that he would not eate it <hi>alone,</hi> for it was to be eaten with the <hi>Familie,</hi> but he puts them in by way of <hi>empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> that I may eate it with <hi>them,</hi> with <hi>all</hi> them, and <hi>only</hi> vvith my Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>There are two things eſpecially commended to us. It is,
<list>
                        <item>Firſt, <hi>generall,</hi> and then</item>
                        <item>It is <hi>excluſive.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That I may eate it with my Diſciples,</hi> and eate it with <hi>none</hi> elſe, even in this particular he ſhewed himſelfe <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient</hi> not only to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Law, but to the <hi>circumſtance</hi> of it: it was the command that God gave <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. for the eating of the paſſover, every one was to eate it with his <hi>Familie,</hi> with his <hi>owne</hi> Familie; the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt were the <hi>familie</hi> of Chriſt, therefore it is that he takes them in, they were his <hi>care,</hi> his <hi>ſheep,</hi> his particular flock, his <hi>ſchollers,</hi> his <hi>pupils,</hi> his <hi>ſervants,</hi> his <hi>children:</hi> in which, according to what <hi>relation</hi> ſoever wee looke on it, there is true reaſon why he ſhould eate it with his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>When he went to be <hi>transfigured</hi> he tooke but 3. <hi>Diſciples, Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> becauſe that was the manifeſtation of his <hi>glorie,</hi> it was not to be diſpenſed to <hi>all,</hi> but only to ſo many as were fit to be witneſſes, but this was a worke of <hi>humiliation,</hi> becauſe it was a worke of <hi>obedience,</hi> the eating of the paſſover, therefore there he takes <hi>all, I with my Diſciples,</hi> becauſe they had that reference to him.</p>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:114893:250"/>
                  <p>To ſhew us how <hi>carefull</hi> wee ſhould be of thoſe that are committed to our charge; <hi>Parents</hi> of <hi>Children, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of <hi>ſervants, Tutours</hi> of their <hi>Schollers; Paſtors</hi> and ſhepheards of their people, and flock. It is the high commendation of any man in <hi>ſuperiour</hi> place that he looks to thoſe that are under him. God would by that Law of eating the Paſſover with their <hi>Familie</hi> give them to underſtand thus much, that in theſe <hi>ſpirituall</hi> references all are alike to him; there is the <hi>ſame</hi> law for the <hi>ſervant</hi> as for the <hi>Maſter, there is neither bond nor free;</hi> there is as free acceſſe for the <hi>ſervant</hi> to the Table of the Lord as for the Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he would commend thus much to them in the fourth commandement, that it belongs to every one that is <hi>above,</hi> in ſuperiour place, to looke to thoſe that are <hi>under</hi> them. It is that teſtimonie that <hi>Solomon</hi> gives to a vertuous matron, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. <hi>She provides meate for her houſhold, and a portion for her Maids.</hi> It is not only to be underſtood of meat <hi>temporal,</hi> but of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It was a high commendation of <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I and my Houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> That is the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie that God gives of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his Familie, he would inſtruct his <hi>Children,</hi> he would teach them in the way of the Lord; and if you will make a good account for your ſelves, you muſt looke to make ſome account for your ſervants, and your Children,; that was the reaſon why our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours care manifeſted it ſelfe ſo much for his Diſciples, he had a care of all that he preached to, and taught, but a more eſpeclall care of them: there was never <hi>Hen</hi> ſo gathered her Chickins, as he clucked his Diſciples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, they were thoſe that had a part in his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they had fellowſhip with him in his <hi>ſufferings;</hi> they were thoſe that left all to follow him, they were
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:114893:251"/>thoſe that were to enlarge the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to plant the <hi>Church,</hi> to be <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to carry his name about all the <hi>World;</hi> it was neceſſary he ſhould have reſpect to <hi>them,</hi> to inſtruct <hi>them</hi> by <hi>precept,</hi> and by example, and ſo he did. He did <hi>publiſh</hi> Parables to <hi>all,</hi> but he did <hi>Expound</hi> them to his Diſciples; he laboured to gather <hi>all,</hi> he kept <hi>them</hi> ſtill under his wing. He healed <hi>all</hi> Diſeaſes, but he waſhed his <hi>Diſciples</hi> feet; he <hi>Preached</hi> obedience to <hi>all,</hi> he <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> obedience in a more particular manner before <hi>them:</hi> he called upon <hi>others</hi> to fullfill the Law, <hi>he</hi> fullfilled the Law to <hi>them;</hi> that they might be <hi>inſtructed,</hi> he eat the Paſſover with his Diſciples. So I have done with the third thing, the laſt of the ſecond generall.</p>
                  <p>I come to the 12. Verſe, and that is the third gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall part of this Text, which is the principall thing to be conſidered in it, the <hi>ſucceſſe,</hi> and ſatisfaction that the Diſciples received when they went to the good man of the houſe, to enquire for the <hi>Gueſt-Chamber.</hi> Chriſt tells them of the ſucceſſe before they come there, they knew their Errand, how they ſhould <hi>ſpeed;</hi> he will ſay thus, and thus, to you.</p>
                  <q>He will ſhew you a large upper Roome furniſhed, there make ready.</q>
                  <p>In which conſider onely theſe 3. things.</p>
                  <p>Here is ſomething of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it ſhews us ſomthing of the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>And ſomewhat of the <hi>Diſciples</hi> that were ſent.</p>
                  <p>Here is the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Sender,</hi> a manifeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and proofe, of Chriſts Divinity that ſent them, he knew before what would befall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is the great <hi>benignity,</hi> and courteſie of the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the Houſe that received them; he ſhews
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:114893:251"/>them preſently, upon their word, a Roome, ſo, and ſo furniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Then, here is the <hi>Buſineſſe</hi> that is given in charge to them that <hi>went,</hi> that were imployed; they muſt make ready in that Roome, and no other.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe is the argument of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt that ſent them; and not one argument onely, here are three couched in it.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Here is a proofe of his Divine <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Here is a proofe of his Divine <hi>Power,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Here is a proofe of his Divine <hi>Providence,</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, here is a proofe of his Divine <hi>Knowledge;</hi> for it runs not thus, aſke <hi>if</hi> there be a <hi>Gueſt-Chamber,</hi> but aſke, <hi>Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi> He knew there was one provided. It runs not thus, ſee if you can meet with one furniſhed, or if you can <hi>induce,</hi> and perſwade him to fit a Roome, but he will ſhew you a large upper Roome, ſo, and ſo furniſhed. Chriſt <hi>knew</hi> it before.</p>
                  <p>That he had <hi>all knowledge</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> all acknowledge, there was never any ſo bold as to Queſtion, he had all knowledge, <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> as God, <hi>created,</hi> and <hi>uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi> whereby he knew the Divine nature, as <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> ſayth, <hi>Abundanter,</hi> and whereby he knew what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is about the <hi>Creature,</hi> in a ſuper-eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Not onely ſo, but he had <hi>all</hi> knowledge as <hi>man,</hi> by vertue of the hypoſtaticall union, there is a <hi>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from the <hi>Divine</hi> nature, that there is nothing that is <hi>done,</hi> or to be <hi>done</hi> in any <hi>part,</hi> or <hi>age</hi> of the World, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> knowes it. It is the reaſon that <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> preſſeth upon them in his time, to draw them to apprehend the <hi>omniſcience</hi> of God (it may be much more preſſed concerning the proofe of the omniſcience of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) doſt thou think that the eye of <hi>man,</hi> then which nothing is more <hi>fraile,</hi> nothing more ſubject to
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:114893:252"/>
                     <hi>miſcarry,</hi> the ſight of it is ſo eaſily put out, doſt thou think the eye of man can paſſe, can <hi>diſcover</hi> an object ſome <hi>Miles</hi> diſtant, that it can look up ſo high as <hi>Heaven?</hi> and ſhall we think that the eye of the <hi>all-ſeeing God</hi> doth not behold every thing at the <hi>ſame</hi> diſtance? Is it ſo, ſayth he, that the <hi>ſoule</hi> of man, though it be in <hi>one</hi> place can think of thoſe things that are done in the <hi>utmoſt</hi> parts of the World, and at the ſame <hi>time</hi> can paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from <hi>one</hi> Country to <hi>another,</hi> from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Aegypt?</hi> and ſhall we not think that the eye of <hi>God,</hi> the eye of him that <hi>made</hi> the eye, ſhall not run through the World in a moment of time? It is plaine, and evident concerning <hi>Chriſt:</hi> things that were <hi>diſtant,</hi> he ſaw them as if they had been under his <hi>eye,</hi> and things that were <hi>future,</hi> as if they had been <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Nathanael</hi> when he was under the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> when <hi>Phillip</hi> called him, Chriſt <hi>ſaw</hi> him; he tells the Woman of <hi>Samaria, whatſoever</hi> ſhee had done in her life, and yet he never <hi>met</hi> with her before. He tells theſe Diſciples that they ſhould meet with a man with a <hi>Pitcher</hi> of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and withall, what the <hi>good man</hi> ſhould ſay to them. Sayth St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I doe not aſke thee now, what is it that thou <hi>doeſt,</hi> or <hi>ſpeakeſt,</hi> but what thou <hi>thinkeſt</hi> that he knowes not? Nay further, I doe not aſke thee what thou thinkeſt, but what thou art <hi>about</hi> to think, but he knowes it better then thy <hi>ſelfe?</hi> He knowes what thou <hi>wilt</hi> think at the <hi>houres</hi> end; he takes notice of things that are done <hi>privately</hi> in the Houſe, his eye pierced as far as the <hi>Chamber,</hi> and Roome of this <hi>good man,</hi> the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Houſe, he ſaw what they were doing, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <hi>rubbing,</hi> and all making <hi>ready,</hi> he diſcerned it. He was not in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> now, but in his paſſage, yet he <hi>ſaw</hi> what was done in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Pleaſe thy ſelfe in thy <hi>ſecrecy,</hi> when thou art about
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:114893:252"/>ſin, he <hi>obſerves</hi> all thy wayes, and knowes thy thoughts long before. Let the <hi>want on</hi> get into never ſo abſtruſe, and <hi>dark</hi> a corner, the eye of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the eye of <hi>Majeſty</hi> will find him out: he ſees that very <hi>complexion</hi> that the Daughters of <hi>pride</hi> lay upon their faces; not onely whatever <hi>good</hi> it is that thou <hi>delighteſt</hi> in, but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>evill</hi> thou <hi>committeſt,</hi> it is all brought within the compaſſe of <hi>Chriſts</hi> eye.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it is a proofe of his <hi>omniſcience,</hi> ſo it is a proofe alſo of his <hi>divine</hi> power; in that he doth not onely <hi>ſee</hi> what is done, but <hi>incline</hi> the good man of the Houſe to <hi>yield</hi> to their motion. Which way ſoever we looke on it, we ſhall ſee a beame of <hi>Omnipotency;</hi> for it muſt be one of theſe two wayes. Either the Maſter of the Houſe did <hi>provide</hi> the Roome on <hi>purpoſe</hi> for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> or for ſome <hi>other.</hi> If he provided it for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then his power was manifeſted, that being <hi>abſent</hi> he could encline the heart of a man that knew him <hi>not,</hi> to make a Roome ready by the <hi>inſtinct</hi> of the Spirit. We read of no Meſſage that he ſent <hi>before,</hi> nay, ſurely he ſent <hi>none,</hi> we read not of any word that paſſed before, and yet as if there had been a <hi>contract</hi> between them, he makes the Roome ready for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>If you take it the other way, that he made the Roome ready for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and his owne <hi>Friends,</hi> for the eating of the Paſſover, there was a <hi>became</hi> of Chriſts <hi>power</hi> too, that that which he had provided for <hi>himſelfe</hi> by <hi>one</hi> word ſpeaking, by this <hi>ſhort</hi> Meſſage by the Diſciples, he <hi>diverted</hi> his purpoſe, and that which he had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> he gives it to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The greateſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> is this, to worke upon an object that is moſt <hi>reſiſting,</hi> to work upon an object that no <hi>Creature</hi> can work upon beſides; and ſuch an object there is none like the <hi>heart</hi> of man; it is not in the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:114893:253"/>Power of <hi>any</hi> Creature, nay, not of <hi>all,</hi> to <hi>incline</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> but onely <hi>God;</hi> and of all other things there is none but hath <hi>leſſe</hi> reſiſtance in it, then the <hi>heart</hi> of man, before it be <hi>ſanctified.</hi> And yet God by his Spirit, he works even upon <hi>that</hi> to incline it, and works <hi>ſweetly</hi> as well as <hi>powerfully,</hi> to make it <hi>pliable</hi> to his owne motions. That was an argument therefore of the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency</hi> of Chriſt, that at ſuch a <hi>diſtance</hi> he could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the <hi>heart</hi> of this man, either to make <hi>ready</hi> a Room for <hi>him,</hi> or to <hi>give</hi> that Roome that he had made ready for <hi>himſelfe,</hi> without any <hi>ſcruple,</hi> or diſpute at all. He ſhewed hereby, ſayth <hi>Theophilact,</hi> that he can even by a <hi>few</hi> infirme, <hi>vaniſhing</hi> words, uttered by his Diſciples, make, and <hi>incline</hi> thoſe to receive him, that did not know him at all. So it was that he wrought upon the heart of the <hi>Thiefe,</hi> when he was upon the Croſſe, to make him confeſſe him; ſo it was, that he wrought at the <hi>ſame</hi> diſtance upon the heart of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> to make her <hi>humble</hi> her ſelfe, and caſt her ſelfe downe. So it was that he wrought on <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when he was in the <hi>Tree</hi> to behold him, readily to give him entertainment.

It was not the caſt of Chriſts eye, but the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>Omnipotent</hi> Spirit of Chriſt that brought him to <hi>repentance,</hi> to which <hi>nothing</hi> is able to be reſiſtant. That is the ſecond thing, it was a proofe of his Divine <hi>knowledge,</hi> and of his <hi>power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, it was a proofe of his divine <hi>providence,</hi> for that is the chiefe; in that he doth incline the heart of this man, and order things of an <hi>inferiour</hi> nature, to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> purpoſes. Whether it were ſo, that this good man, the Maſter of the Houſe, had provided this Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the Paſſover, for his <hi>owne</hi> celebration, whether
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:114893:253"/>it were a Roome <hi>already</hi> furniſhed to <hi>civill</hi> reſpects, here it is that the <hi>providence</hi> of Chriſt appeares as God, that even that which was for <hi>civill,</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> reſpects, he orders ſo, as it ſhall ſerve for <hi>religious</hi> uſes. It is his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> that <hi>Governs</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> that takes notice of <hi>all</hi> things, and brings <hi>glory</hi> out of the <hi>leaſt</hi> effect, of what <hi>kind</hi> ſoever: of what <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>note</hi> ſoever the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>action</hi> be, it is within the compaſſe of Gods <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> and the providence of God ſo <hi>regulates</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>Epieures,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> of the World, diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, that it is a <hi>diſparagement</hi> to God to know the <hi>leaſt</hi> things. Shall his <hi>providence</hi> goe ſo <hi>low</hi> as to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our <hi>hairs,</hi> to take notice of the <hi>leaves</hi> of the Trees that fall? We ſee not his <hi>end</hi> in it, but God <hi>knowes</hi> it. Nay, in our <hi>ſelves</hi> we may ſee that it is no <hi>diſhonour</hi> to God that theſe things fall within his <hi>providence,</hi> how muſt not he take <hi>notice</hi> of that of which he cannot be <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi> but it is no <hi>diſparagement.</hi> A <hi>godly</hi> man can draw <hi>wiſe</hi> concluſions out of things of <hi>leſſe</hi> note.

                  <p>St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his Commentary upon the Pſalmes, he takes the <hi>

                        </gap>ures,</hi> and reaſons with them: thoſe that diſputed againſt Gods <hi>providence,</hi> as if it were a <hi>diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> for God to take notice of <hi>inferiour</hi> things. One Argument that they brought, was, what the reaſon was, that it ſhould <hi>raine</hi> on the <hi>Sea?</hi> The <hi>Sea</hi> needs no Water; there is the <hi>concourſe</hi> of water; they make the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:114893:254"/>argument thus, how this ſhould come to paſſe, that the <hi>Earth</hi> gapes for raine, and gets it <hi>not,</hi> and the <hi>Sea</hi> hath <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance</hi> of water, and yet it <hi>raines</hi> upon it at the <hi>ſame</hi> time, where is providence? Poore Creatures (ſayth he) that doe not conſider the <hi>end</hi> of things. Is there no <hi>end</hi> that God raines upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> though men could not find it out; but we may find it: there are <hi>Fiſhes</hi> in the Sea for God to <hi>nouriſh,</hi> living in the <hi>ſalt</hi> water, how doe they <hi>leap</hi> and <hi>rejoyce</hi> at the <hi>ſweet</hi> raine? How doe they <hi>leap</hi> at the <hi>ſweet</hi> water? they can fetch it out of the ſalt Sea. Then, here is the reaſon, ſayth St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> it <hi>raines</hi> upon the <hi>Sea</hi> where there is water <hi>enough</hi> for the feeding of the <hi>Fiſhes;</hi> it raines <hi>not</hi> upon the <hi>Earth</hi> where there is <hi>need</hi> of water for the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of <hi>man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Argument they brought, was this, what was the reaſon that the <hi>lightening</hi> ſhould ſtrike the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and yet not ſtrike the <hi>Robber</hi> that is at the foot of the Mountaine, that is by the way, that takes a <hi>Purſe</hi> at the ſame time; where is Gods <hi>Providence?</hi> what is the <hi>Mountaine</hi> the <hi>better,</hi> or the <hi>worſe,</hi> for the ſtriking of the <hi>lightening?</hi> If Gods <hi>providence</hi> were <hi>manifeſted,</hi> he would ſtrike the <hi>Thiefe,</hi> the <hi>Mountaine</hi> hath done no <hi>evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See their <hi>vanity</hi> (ſayth he) that will ſearch into the depth of that <hi>providence. Percutiuntur montes, &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Mountaines</hi> are ſmitten that doe <hi>not</hi> feare, that <hi>men</hi> might feare that ſhould have <hi>beene</hi> ſmitten. Among your <hi>ſelves</hi> doe none of your <hi>Wives</hi> beat the <hi>ground</hi> when the <hi>Child</hi> cries, to make the <hi>Child</hi> affrayd? Ye your ſelves will beat the <hi>Earth,</hi> that the <hi>Infant</hi> may be afraid, and <hi>tremble,</hi> and will you not ſuffer God to make <hi>lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> to fall upon the <hi>Mountaines,</hi> to make <hi>men</hi> afraid, that they may be warned?</p>
                  <p>Another Argument was this, what was the reaſon that Gods <hi>judgements</hi> doe <hi>overtake,</hi> and fall upon the
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:114893:254"/>heads of <hi>godly</hi> perſons ſometimes, and doe not take the <hi>wicked,</hi> where is <hi>providence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, there Gods <hi>providence</hi> is <hi>ſeene,</hi> in that that ſeems a <hi>judgement</hi> to us, that falls upon the head of a <hi>righteous</hi> man, God knowes him to be <hi>ready,</hi> he takes <hi>away</hi> thoſe that are <hi>fitted,</hi> and it falls <hi>not</hi> upon the head of the <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitent,</hi> God <hi>ſpares</hi> him that he may <hi>repent;</hi> here is the Argument of Gods <hi>providence</hi> while we reaſon againſt it. But ſee the <hi>iniquity</hi> of theſe men; if they come into a <hi>Smiths</hi> Shop and ſee here the <hi>Anvill,</hi> and there a <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and here the <hi>Trough,</hi> and there the <hi>Fire,</hi> they would not take upon them to <hi>diſpute,</hi> and aſke the reaſon of the <hi>Anvile</hi> being <hi>here,</hi> or the Trough <hi>there;</hi> why? Becauſe they are <hi>unſkillfull,</hi> and ignorant, and they would ſay within themſelves, the <hi>Smith</hi> knowes the reaſon of all theſe things, though I doe not that am <hi>ignorant.</hi> Look but on the <hi>iniquity</hi> of theſe men, they will not find fault with the <hi>Smith</hi> in his Shop, in the Myſteries of his Trade, becauſe they <hi>know</hi> them not, yet ſo <hi>preſumptuous</hi> are they, as to call Gods <hi>providence</hi> in queſtion, that they are <hi>ignorant</hi> of. It is juſt ſo in <hi>other</hi> queſtions that they propound, what is the reaſon that God ſhould take <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> of <hi>inferiour</hi> things? Nay, all theſe <hi>inferiour</hi> things, God can extend them to <hi>holy</hi> purpoſes. What is of leſs moment then a <hi>Crow,</hi> or a <hi>Raven?</hi> Yet God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence feeds them, and made them feed <hi>Elias.</hi> What is of <hi>leſſe</hi> value then a <hi>haire</hi> of ones head? Yet even from them God drawes an argument of his <hi>providence,</hi> the <hi>Haires</hi> of the head of the three Children were not <hi>ſinged</hi> in the Furnace. What is of <hi>leſſe</hi> moment then for a man to beare a <hi>Pitcher</hi> of water? What is a <hi>Pitcher</hi> of water to Gods <hi>providence?</hi> Yes, God guided it to a <hi>good</hi> end, to the Diſciples, ſhewing them hereby where they might eat the <hi>Paſſover.</hi> What is of <hi>leſſe</hi> notice then the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:114893:255"/>
                     <hi>rubbing</hi> of a Floore, then the <hi>dreſſing</hi> up of a Chamber? <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his providence <hi>ſaw</hi> this, and ordered it at the ſame time for the place where he would keep the <hi>Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and bring <hi>glory</hi> to God. So, though we ſee not the <hi>reaſon</hi> of theſe <hi>inferiour</hi> things God doth, he can draw <hi>great</hi> concluſions out of <hi>meane</hi> things; there is not the <hi>meaneſt</hi> Creature in the World, but God takes <hi>notice</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>But there is a <hi>difference</hi> (and ſo I conclude the point) Saith St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> we are not ſuch <hi>flatterers</hi> of Gods <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> as to think that it is <hi>equally</hi> communicated to all. He regards <hi>other</hi> Creatures in <hi>generall,</hi> but <hi>man</hi> in <hi>ſpeciall.</hi> God takes care even over the <hi>lowest</hi> Creatures, of every <hi>Worme,</hi> but it is for the <hi>governing</hi> of them. He gives <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior</hi> Creatures no <hi>precepts, Doth God take care for Oxen,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle? That is, doth he take ſuch care for <hi>Oxen</hi> as he doth for <hi>men?</hi> Sayth St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> the <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of God extends to <hi>all,</hi> but his <hi>particular</hi> care ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> to his <hi>choſen.</hi> Out of thoſe <hi>other</hi> Creatures it is, that God drawes <hi>particular</hi> concluſions of <hi>good</hi> to them. If a man ſhould have come into <hi>this</hi> Roome, he would have thought it had beene for <hi>other</hi> purpoſes, Chriſt directs it to the glory of God, that that very <hi>Roome</hi> that was ſo furniſhed, ſhould be imployed to eat the Paſſover with his Diſciples. So I have done with the firſt.</p>
                  <p>There are two points behind, I ſhall be briefe in them. We ſee concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> here is a proofe of his divine <hi>knowledge,</hi> of his <hi>power,</hi> and of his <hi>providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing is to conſider the <hi>humanity</hi> of him that received him (and that is more for our uſe) A man would have thought that there had beene a <hi>contract</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this <hi>Maſter</hi> of the houſe, and Chriſt, that he made ready the Roome when he ſent, ſo <hi>freely.</hi> There
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:114893:255"/>was but one word ſpoken, there was no <hi>deniall</hi> received, there was no <hi>diſpute</hi> made; had it not beene that the great, efficacious <hi>power</hi> of the ſpirit, had wrought migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and <hi>ſtrongly</hi> upon his heart, he could not have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſo <hi>preſently.</hi> Therefore I will refer it to 3 heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it was the aſſent of a <hi>pious</hi> heart, it makes not diſputes, and ſayth, <hi>Who</hi> is your Maſter? The <hi>Maſter</hi> ſends, <hi>Who</hi> is he? Upon what <hi>acquaintance?</hi> What have <hi>I</hi> to <hi>doe</hi> with him? How came he to <hi>know</hi> that I have a Roome furniſhed? Muſt <hi>I</hi> find a Gueſt-Chamber for <hi>him?</hi> It was the anſwer of <hi>Naball, Who is David? And who is the Son of Jeſse? Shall I take my Bread, and my Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my Fleſh that I have killed for my Shearers, and give it unto men whom I know not whence they be?</hi> It is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the obſtinate heart to God, when he comes to knock; <hi>Who</hi> is he that would enter? Is it the <hi>World?</hi> or the <hi>fleſh,</hi> or <hi>ſin?</hi> here is a Chamber provided; if it be <hi>God,</hi> there is none at all. This good man he raiſeth no <hi>Scruples,</hi> why; I am to keep the Paſſover my <hi>ſelfe;</hi> ſhall not I be <hi>obedient</hi> to the Law? Muſt <hi>his</hi> obedience exclude <hi>mine?</hi> Beſides, I cannot doe it without a great deale of <hi>hazzard,</hi> and danger of the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they will know that I give entertainment to him, I ſhall bring my ſelfe in <hi>danger;</hi> He is not ignorant how they <hi>waite</hi> for him, and how they <hi>perſecute</hi> this way to death, and will he have a Roome in <hi>my</hi> Houſe? He muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me. He hath none of theſe <hi>fears,</hi> he makes none of theſe <hi>ſcruples.</hi> That is the nature of <hi>true piety,</hi> it raiſeth no vaine <hi>feares,</hi> if there had been <hi>fears</hi> entertain'd in the way, we h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d had no <hi>Martyrs.</hi> It never ſayth, <hi>There is a Lyon in the way,</hi> but <hi>leaps</hi> over <hi>all</hi> obſtacles. If <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> ſhould all be cruſhed together, it leaps over all impediments to come to <hi>God.</hi> So it was the Aſſent of a <hi>pious</hi> heart.</p>
                  <pb n="476" facs="tcp:114893:256"/>
                  <p>Secondly, it was the aſſent of a <hi>charitable</hi> heart, it was a motion of <hi>charitie</hi> that was made, as well as a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>pietie:</hi> therefore hee makes not any <hi>coveteous</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands firſt, here is a <hi>roome</hi> indeed that may ſerve your Maſter, but what will you give? at this time the whole Citie of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is full of people, and I can have <hi>great</hi> allowance for my lodgings; will your Maſter <hi>pay</hi> for the hire of it? he makes none of thoſe demands; nay he pretends not any <hi>excuſe;</hi> it is true, I <hi>had</hi> a roome, but it is taken up <hi>alreadie,</hi> there are friends in it, I am ſorry you came ſo <hi>late,</hi> if you had come <hi>ſooner,</hi> I ſhould have beene willing to pleaſure you, but now it is paſt: he layes in the way no <hi>diſcouragements,</hi> here is a gueſt-Chamber, here are <hi>diverſe</hi> Chambers, any of theſe <hi>inferiour</hi> ones, if any of <hi>theſe</hi> will pleaſe and content you you ſhall have them, but I may not part with my <hi>beſt,</hi> I muſt not have it <hi>ſoiled</hi> and wronged, it coſt much <hi>paines</hi> in trimming; there are <hi>none</hi> of theſe objections. <hi>Charitie</hi> caſts no <hi>doubts,</hi> it makes no <hi>ſcruples,</hi> I ſhall want my <hi>ſelf:</hi> but with a <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>large,</hi> and chearefull heart he aſſents to the motion, as ſoone as it is made: they doe but ſpeake, <hi>Where is the gueſt-Chamber?</hi> and he carries them to it, <hi>here</hi> it is, and ſhewes them the roome ſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                  <p>It is the propertie of <hi>charitie,</hi> and <hi>pietie</hi> to give <hi>preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and to give the <hi>beſt</hi> to God: true pietie will not ſet the Tith-cock at the <hi>end</hi> of the land, and it may be the <hi>worſt;</hi> it will not bring the tith-<hi>pig</hi> to <hi>cling</hi> together; no, but out of a large, and <hi>bountifull</hi> heart, it ſaith, it is <hi>Gods</hi> portion, he ſhall have it <hi>freely.</hi> This roome is not mine, ſo much as <hi>Gods:</hi> here take it, let your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter come, and <hi>welcome,</hi> my houſe ſhall be <hi>bleſt</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it was the aſſent of an <hi>obedient</hi> heart that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:114893:256"/>knew that his houſe ſhould be <hi>honoured</hi> by the preſence of Chriſt, he knew where Chriſt came, he brought a <hi>bleſſing</hi> with him: he knew this roome ſhould be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced, that he ſhould have a roome ten thouſand times better in <hi>heaven,</hi> that he ſhould have one of the <hi>manſions</hi> that Chriſt had prepared: he knew that he cannot want a lodging that gives <hi>Chriſt</hi> one, therefore he provides a large roome, the <hi>beſt,</hi> that was moſt fit for the traine of Chriſt, a <hi>great</hi> upper roome, it was moſt ſafe for Chriſt to be in a <hi>loft,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that lay in waite for him, a roome <hi>furniſhed</hi> was moſt anſwerable for ſo <hi>great</hi> a gueſt as Chriſt: a roome <hi>prepared,</hi> this was the roome.</p>
                  <p>Shall my houſe be honoured with ſuch a gueſt thought he? will he come, and viſit me; will he tread on this floore, O <hi>welcome!</hi> welcome Saviour to my Houſe. Muſt the <hi>Temple</hi> remove out of its place to my <hi>Houſe?</hi> Shall my Houſe be the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church? Will Chriſt here keep his <hi>laſt</hi> Paſſover? Will the Son of <hi>God</hi> come under this <hi>Roofe?</hi> The very <hi>stones</hi> of the wall will <hi>leap</hi> for joy at his preſence, it is to be feared the Houſe will <hi>fall</hi> with joy; nay, I am ſure the Houſe will <hi>ſtand,</hi> becauſe he will <hi>ſupport</hi> it. But I am <hi>unworthy</hi> he ſhould come under my roofe, I have no <hi>fit</hi> Lodging for ſo <hi>great</hi> a Gueſt: but if he will needs come, why doe you aſke for a <hi>Chamber?</hi> Take the <hi>whole,</hi> not a <hi>Roome</hi> onely, but the whole <hi>Houſe,</hi> and not upon <hi>loane,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Gift.</hi> It is <hi>mine</hi> no longer, my <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> and my <hi>felfe</hi> and all will goe <hi>out,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may come <hi>in.</hi> Thus it is likely he ſpake, he gave no <hi>churliſh</hi> anſwer, he gave even that anſwer that Chriſt ſet downe; he that inclined him to <hi>give,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined him thus to <hi>anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How can the heart denie <hi>God</hi> when he comes to <hi>beg?</hi>
                     <pb n="478" facs="tcp:114893:257"/>When he that <hi>gives</hi> all comes to <hi>ask?</hi> He comes oft to us, and goes away <hi>without</hi> his Errand. He comes oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the habite of a <hi>Poore</hi> man, and begs a <hi>lodging,</hi> and aſkes for the <hi>Gueſt-Chamber,</hi> and the Roome, there are <hi>many</hi> that are furniſhed for <hi>worſe</hi> uſes, and never a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> that Chriſt can be thruſt into. He that <hi>found</hi> a roome in <hi>bloudy Jeruſalem,</hi> is <hi>excluded</hi> out of the <hi>Houſes</hi> of many <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and left in the ſtreets.

The entertainment that this <hi>humble</hi> man gave Chriſt in the Text, he finds it not with <hi>us;</hi> we are ſo far from giving him a Chamber, that we ſhut him <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>Houſe:</hi> we are ſo far from giving him any thing that is <hi>ours,</hi> that we <hi>take</hi> from him that that is <hi>his.</hi> We take <hi>the Houſes of God into our owne poſſeſſion: Churches,</hi> and <hi>Chancells</hi> are in the power of <hi>lay-men;</hi> poore <hi>Miniſters</hi> they <hi>bury,</hi> and <hi>ſecular</hi> men they have the <hi>fees.</hi> The <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Sanctorum,</hi> that the high Prieſt <hi>onely</hi> might enter into, and onely <hi>once</hi> a yeare, it is now in the poſſeſſion of <hi>lay-perſons,</hi> the place that anſwers to that, the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> Is this an argument of a heart that would receive <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Would we <hi>part</hi> with any of <hi>our</hi> Rooms for Chriſt, that have taken theſe from <hi>him?</hi> Think of it, think of it; it may be that <hi>little</hi> moytie of their eſtate, is that that makes <hi>all</hi> moulder away when all is done; for <hi>whoſoever</hi> hath right to them, <hi>you</hi> have none. It was a better reſolution that this man makes to himſelfe, and we ſhould practiſe that.</p>
                  <p>I have done with the ſecond thing. Here is the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> of him that <hi>ſent</hi> them, and the great <hi>benignity</hi> of
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:114893:257"/>him that <hi>received</hi> them; as ſoone as they had made the motion, he wellcomes it.</p>
                  <p>Now thirdly, here is the laſt thing, and then I have done, here is the <hi>buſineſſe</hi> and imployment of them that did <hi>goe, There prepare,</hi> and no otherwiſe. Chriſt, as he ſent a <hi>Meſſage</hi> to him, ſo he gave a <hi>Commandement</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> he made them his <hi>Harbingers</hi> to mark out his lodging, and directs them <hi>what</hi> lodging he would have, as though he had beene <hi>acquainted</hi> in the Houſe. Make <hi>ready,</hi> there <hi>prepare</hi> for the Paſſover. It was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that was then given to <hi>them,</hi> but it is a great deale better direction to <hi>us,</hi> and concernes us <hi>more</hi> then it did them. It hath a truth now, there is a Roome of <hi>this</hi> nature that Chriſt will be entertained in; it muſt be a <hi>large upper Roome,</hi> and a Roome <hi>furniſhed.</hi> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> obſerves it, that there are <hi>three</hi> Gueſt-Chambers, there are <hi>three</hi> Rooms in which Chriſt is received.</p>
                  <p>There is the Chamber of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that is a <hi>large Roome,</hi> becauſe there is in it <hi>all</hi> ſaving Truths. That is an <hi>upper</hi> Roome, becauſe it was <hi>penned,</hi> and inſpired by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God that came from <hi>above.</hi> That is a Roome <hi>furniſhed,</hi> there is a ſtorehouſe of all comforts, upon all occaſions: for men in <hi>want,</hi> for men in <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> for men in <hi>proſperity,</hi> for <hi>young,</hi> for <hi>old,</hi> for <hi>all</hi> ſorts, there are truths to be applied, and directed. When is it that this Room is <hi>prepared?</hi> Then the Roome of the Scripture is <hi>prepared</hi> for God, when the bread of life is <hi>rightly</hi> broken, and divided to the people, then this Roome is made <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is another <hi>Chamber,</hi> and that is the Chamber of the <hi>Church.</hi> All the properties alſo meet in this Roome; it is a <hi>large</hi> Roome, the corners of it ſpread to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> parts of the Earth. And it is an <hi>upper</hi> roome, the <hi>upper</hi> part of it is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the Church
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:114893:258"/>
                     <hi>tryumphant,</hi> and thence it is, that all <hi>grace</hi> comes, and falls upon it. It is a Roome <hi>furniſhed,</hi> ſayth <hi>Jerome</hi> well. It is furniſhed with variety of <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> that God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and appointed. It is a <hi>dineing</hi> Roome, it is a <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> Chamber. It is a <hi>Gueſt-Chamber,</hi> properly, that ſayth <hi>Jerome,</hi> becauſe there it is that we meet at the Lords <hi>Table,</hi> we partake of the Lords <hi>Supper,</hi> even to the <hi>end</hi> of the World. The Church of God, it is a <hi>ſupping Gueſt-Chamber.</hi> When is this Chamber provided, and <hi>prepared</hi> for Chriſt? Then when the <hi>wheat</hi> is gathered into the <hi>Barne,</hi> then when men are gathered into the boſome of the <hi>Church,</hi> and preſerved there, then, when they are <hi>built</hi> up in this <hi>holy</hi> faith, then this Roome is <hi>prepared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is yet another, the Chamber of the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> the Chamber of the <hi>heart,</hi> that is <hi>Caenaculum</hi> too; a ſpiritnall <hi>ſupping</hi> Roome, and place for Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>I will come and ſup with him,</hi> ſayth Chriſt in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Chap. 3.20. <hi>I and my Father will come and ſup</hi> with ſuch a man. Chriſt will come and <hi>Sup</hi> with that man that <hi>receives</hi> him: he will ſup with the <hi>faithfull</hi> ſoule; that is, he will <hi>dwell</hi> there, and take up his <hi>lodging.</hi> Here is the Roome that Chriſt <hi>wants,</hi> and that is the Roome that we muſt <hi>prepare.</hi> It was a <hi>materiall</hi> Roome that they were to provide, that Roome that God calls to us for, is the Roome of the <hi>heart.</hi> Think not that it is the Roome, the <hi>Chamber,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayth. Chriſt alludes to it, when he ſayth of the godly man, that in Prayer he will get into his <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and <hi>ſhut</hi> his Doore. Every man that will pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, enters into the <hi>Chamber</hi> of his <hi>Conſcience. David</hi> ſayth plainly in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Enter into your Chamber,</hi> into the Cabbin of the <hi>heart,</hi> this is the Roome that we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide.
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:114893:258"/>It hath all the properties too, God will not feaſt in any other hearts, then thoſe that are <hi>provided.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, it was a <hi>large</hi> Roome where the Lord did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and eat his Supper. A large Roome is an <hi>enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> heart, enlarged with <hi>Devotion,</hi> and <hi>thankfullneſſe.</hi> We muſt not put Chriſt in a <hi>corner,</hi> we muſt not <hi>pen</hi> him up. He will have the <hi>whole houſe,</hi> and the <hi>whole heart,</hi> it is that he calls for, <hi>My Son give me thy heart;</hi> that is as much in effect as <hi>Where is the Gueſt-Chamber?</hi> there I will <hi>lodge,</hi> there I will <hi>baite,</hi> and there I will <hi>ſtay,</hi> and abide and <hi>dwell,</hi> make ready that <hi>Roome,</hi> let it be a <hi>large</hi> Roome, and a large <hi>heart</hi> for God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it muſt be an <hi>upper</hi> Roome too, the <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> heart is the <hi>upper</hi> Roome, a heart <hi>lift up,</hi> it is the word that is uſed in the <hi>Pſalmes, I lift up my heart,</hi> yet we keep them <hi>grovelling</hi> upon Earth. Art thou not aſhamed? Look upon thy ſelfe, why hath God given thee <hi>eyes,</hi> and ſet them in <hi>that</hi> place <hi>aloft</hi> (whereas he hath ſet them <hi>forwards</hi> in other Creatures) but that they ſhould be <hi>oft</hi> lifted up to Heaven? Why hath God given man a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not other Creatures, but that it ſhould be <hi>lifted</hi> up oft? Is it not a ſhame then to have thy <hi>head</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, and thy <hi>heart</hi> below, grovelling upon the Earth? Is it not a ſhame for thee to be <hi>upright</hi> in <hi>body,</hi> and to <hi>creep</hi> upon the Earth in thy <hi>mind?</hi> God, that cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a heart that is <hi>puffed</hi> up, he expects a heart that is <hi>lifted</hi> up, and thus elevated to him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the Old Teſtament we find, that in all holy performances, to ſignifie the <hi>elevation</hi> of the heart, the Saints went <hi>up;</hi> Chriſt would be transfigured in the <hi>top</hi> of the Mount; he often Preached to the People from <hi>Mountaines,</hi> to note, his <hi>Heavenly</hi> Doctrine. He did oft withdraw himſelfe for Prayer, and he prayed upon the <hi>Mountaines.</hi> So did <hi>Daniel</hi> get himſelfe into
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:114893:259"/>an <hi>upper</hi> Roome. So <hi>Peter,</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> he got to the <hi>top</hi> of the Houſe, not onely for <hi>privacy,</hi> but to note, that a man that will goe to meet God, he muſt <hi>aſcend</hi> higher in his ſpirit. Therefore <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw a <hi>Ladder</hi> in his Dreame, to note, that every man that comes before God in <hi>Prayer,</hi> or in any <hi>holy</hi> performance, he muſt <hi>aſcend.</hi> Sayth St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> well, <hi>aſcend</hi> thou in holy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, let thy heart be <hi>lifted</hi> up. Doe that indeed that thou art incited to in receiving the Sacrament, <hi>Lift up your hearts,</hi> it muſt be a Roome aloft, an <hi>upper</hi> Roome, <hi>We lift them up to the Lord.</hi> Then know, if thou wilt be partaker of thoſe <hi>divine</hi> Myſteries, if thou wilt have true comfort of that <hi>ſupreame</hi> union, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pietas, &amp;c. Devotion</hi> will <hi>knit</hi> thoſe together, that the Elements in the World hath ſeperated; we are <hi>ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> from the Saints in Heaven, but <hi>faith,</hi> and a <hi>heavenly</hi> converſation will <hi>knit</hi> us together; we ſhall have <hi>union</hi> with that ſociety. If we will give God a Roome fit to welcome him, it muſt be a <hi>large</hi> Roome, and an <hi>upper</hi> Roome, a heavenly heart.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it muſt be a <hi>furniſhed</hi> Roome; what is the <hi>furniture?</hi> The variety of <hi>graces</hi> wherewith the heart and <hi>Conſcience</hi> of a man is to be adorned, that is the <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.</hi> Carefull we are to provide <hi>furniture</hi> for our <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and for our <hi>Houſes,</hi> and for our <hi>Chambers</hi> in which we lodge, but there is a <hi>Chamber</hi> that is <hi>in</hi> us, that is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. The Saints of God had a care of this, ſayth St. <hi>Bernard. Every</hi> Saint provided <hi>ſome</hi> furniture when they came to God. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> the furniture that ſhee provided was in <hi>humility,</hi> ſhee laid a <hi>ſure</hi> foundation. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle, he made his proviſion in <hi>ſolidity</hi> of faith. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, he made his proviſion in the enlargement of <hi>love. Paul</hi> made his furniture in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:114893:259"/>inward ſecrets, and <hi>Myſteries</hi> of divine wiſdome; and <hi>Peter,</hi> his in <hi>repentance.</hi> So <hi>every</hi> one that will <hi>receive</hi> Chriſt, and wellcome him, muſt make <hi>proviſion.</hi> What is the proviſion that he requires? <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>repentance;</hi> the <hi>beleiving</hi> heart, and the <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nitent</hi> heart. Let the roome be <hi>waſhed,</hi> let there be repentance, and then it is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</hi> Let the Roome be <hi>ſwept,</hi> let there be <hi>faith,</hi> and then it is <hi>provided.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>hangings,</hi> and the <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,</hi> and much <hi>more</hi> that you may add in your owne Meditations. This is the heart where Chriſt will lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ge. Remember theſe things you that are to receive the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</hi> This man that gave entertainment to Chriſt, thought it a <hi>diſhonour</hi> to bring him into any Room that was not <hi>prepared,</hi> he made it <hi>ready</hi> before Chriſt ſent, by the <hi>inſtinct</hi> of the Spirit, by <hi>one</hi> word of the two Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. God ſends to <hi>you,</hi> Diſciples not ſo <hi>powerfull</hi> in ſpeaking, but Diſciples after Diſciples, and intreats you to make <hi>ready.</hi> He ſends not a <hi>Commanding</hi> word, <hi>where is it?</hi> He aſks not ſo; but he <hi>beſeecheth</hi> you that you would make your hearts <hi>ready.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now is the <hi>ſolemne</hi> time to bring <hi>furniſhed</hi> hearts; it was at this time, when Chriſt went in <hi>triumph</hi> to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> they cut boughs of <hi>palme,</hi> and ſtrewed them in the way, to ſhew that he was the only Conquerour, it was then that they cut downe boughs of trees; to ſhew how powerfull the Evangelicall <hi>Axe</hi> was that was laid to their conſciences, to bring them to the duties of <hi>pietie,</hi> they did not only ſtrew <hi>boughs,</hi> but their <hi>garments;</hi> that is, ſaith St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> well, all their <hi>glorie,</hi> and <hi>dignitie,</hi> they were not aſhamed to lay <hi>all</hi> at Chriſts <hi>feet;</hi> it may be ſome of their cloathes were <hi>coſtly;</hi> you, will not part with a <hi>faſhion,</hi> you will not conſecrate <hi>one</hi> to Chriſt: nay, the more you are ſpoken to, and <hi>entreated,</hi> the more
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:114893:260"/>you encreaſe in your <hi>exorbitancie.</hi> Doe you think that ever Chriſt will lodge in that <hi>boſome,</hi> that is ſet to ſale to every <hi>ludibrious</hi> wanton eye? will Chriſt take his roome there? judge ye; thinke with your ſelves, will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in that <hi>braine,</hi> to ſanctifie the imaginations of it, that is ſo <hi>frizled?</hi> and that he will glorifie that <hi>face</hi> that is ſo altred to <hi>another</hi> colour then he gave it? doe you <hi>furniſh</hi> and provide your bodies ſo for Chriſt? cares he for theſe carriages? muſt theſe be your <hi>Eaſter</hi> entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? will ye thus prepare to come to the Lords <hi>Table?</hi> I tell you, I am conſcious to my ſelfe of worſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then you have. I dare not deny to adminſter the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to any man that reacheth out his <hi>hand</hi> to take it; if there be any that goe on in ſinne, my <hi>charitie</hi> ſhall thinke that there is <hi>repentance</hi> within: but I doe it with a <hi>trembling</hi> heart: I rather wiſh my ſelfe <hi>No Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor the Sonne of a Prophet.</hi> Never come to Church and receive thoſe <hi>myſteries</hi> in ſuch a <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite:</hi> where the <hi>outward</hi> vanitie is, I ſay, there is not the <hi>inward</hi> preparation, there is not a making <hi>readie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee had need to provide more <hi>zealouſly,</hi> and <hi>carefully</hi> for the eating of the Lords <hi>Supper,</hi> then they for the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> it is a Sacrament of more worth and eminencie.</p>
                  <p>O that there were but the ſame man to guide you! the man with the pitcher of water.</p>
                  <p>I come to you with the <hi>booke,</hi> and with the <hi>word</hi> of God, follow yet that direction; and if you will give me the other, ſo ſhall you have the approbation here that Chriſt gave this man he ſhall not ſay, <hi>where</hi> is the gueſt-Chamber? but I have found it, here

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the Myſteries of the Goſpell are things well worthy the Studie of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> I ſhewed in the beginning of this Feaſt, from the Text that I handled the firſt day. I then ſpake of it, and I hoped then to have made an end of theſe Meditations. Then I conſidered, that as I began this Feaſt with ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Myſteries,</hi> ſo there could not be a better Subject choſen for the ſealing up of the ſame. And this Text that I have choſen now, will anſwer that firſt Scripture; for indeed it is much at one, for it ſhews that the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpell, are worthy not onely of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but of <hi>Angells.</hi> Therefore it is that I have now made choiſe of this Scripture to be the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fullfilling of that firſt dayes. Indeed they were very far fetched; however they have a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence in this Chapter of <hi>Peter,</hi> yet they might have as good connexion to thoſe words of <hi>Paul. That I ſhould make knowne the Myſteries of the Goſpell,</hi> ſayth St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
                     <pb n="490" facs="tcp:114893:263"/>that is the Text I began with, and theſe words ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that, make it full and compleat. <hi>That I ſhould make knowne the Myſteries of the Goſpell, which things the Angells deſire to looke into.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a Scripture that hath ſome <hi>difficulty</hi> in it, and will be well worth our ſtudy, eſpecially ſince it ſpeaks of <hi>Angells,</hi> and agrees with the ſolemnity that is paſt, in a <hi>better,</hi> and nearer nature then the former. The firſt Text told us of the <hi>Chriſtians Chriſtmas;</hi> this Text goes further, and tells us how it is obſerved by the <hi>Angells</hi> themſelves. That ſeeing it is the birth of Chriſt that adminiſters joy to the <hi>Angells,</hi> it is the common theame of both, let us now ſee in theſe words the common ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and inſpection, and ſpeculation of both.</p>
                  <p>That the incarnation of Chriſt, it was to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of the <hi>faithfull,</hi> our bleſſed Saviour ſhews, in <hi>John</hi> 8. <hi>Abraham deſired to ſee my day, and ſaw it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced.</hi> That it was the common ſtudy of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhews it here, <hi>The Prophets enquired after it:</hi> that it was the common ſtudy of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>I deſire to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt, and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> that it is the common ſtudie of <hi>Saints,</hi> the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. <hi>That ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the height, and breadth, and length, and depth, &amp;c.</hi> Now that it is the common ſtudy of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us; after that he had mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>glory,</hi> and the <hi>diſeent</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, and the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Apoſtles; he cloſeth all up with this honourable concluſion, <hi>Into theſe things the Angells deſire to looke.</hi> That I may the better therefore goe on with the reſolution, and full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe words, I will reduce all that I am to ſay of them, to theſe three parts, that naturally riſe out of the conſideration of the words.</p>

                     <hi>Who</hi> are the <hi>Angells</hi> here ſpoken of, whome the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayth <hi>They</hi> deſire to looke into the Myſteries of the incarnation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What</hi> thoſe <hi>good</hi> things are that they deſire to looke into?</p>
                  <p>And what is the <hi>root</hi> of this deſire, that carries them to this inſpection? Theſe are the three things I ſhall conſider.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Qui Angeli,</hi> who theſe Angels are, <hi>Didimus Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi> in his Commentarie upon this place (it ſeems in his time they interpreted this place of the <hi>evill</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the <hi>evill</hi> Angels: and <hi>Lorinus</hi> the Jeſuite he goes about to ſhew ſo much out of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> that <hi>Clemens</hi> not onely (though I find not the place) makes <hi>mention</hi> of the Interpretation, but <hi>refutes</hi> them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here now there is good occaſion given, to ſearch well into the firſt thing, to know <hi>who</hi> theſe Students are, theſe that are the glorious <hi>beholders,</hi> and Scrutators of this heavenly myſtery, that are the inſpectors here ſpoken of; theſe good Inquiſitors, to know <hi>what</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells they are. Therefore briefly I will reduce it to theſe Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, <hi>Negative,</hi> that the place cannot poſſibly be underſtood of <hi>evill</hi> Angells, of evill Spirits, for theſe two reaſons.</p>
                  <p>One reaſon is taken from the <hi>name,</hi> and appellation of <hi>Angells.</hi> Though the <hi>name</hi> be given ſometimes in Scripture to the <hi>evill</hi> Spirits, yet generally when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them, there is ſome word of <hi>addition</hi> annexed, whereby it may be knowne of whome the Scripture ſpeaks. The <hi>evill</hi> Angells, the Angells of <hi>Satan,</hi> the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:114893:264"/>Angell of the <hi>bottomleſſe</hi> Pit: the Angells that kept not their <hi>firſt</hi> eſtate, the Angells that <hi>ſinned,</hi> and the like. Or if there be not ſome ſuch <hi>clauſe</hi> of <hi>addition,</hi> yet there is alway ſome <hi>circumſtance</hi> of <hi>Interpretation,</hi> that directs, and points out who thoſe Angells are, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls thoſe <hi>evill</hi> Spirits <hi>Angells,</hi> as, <hi>The Devill and his Angells, Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>Know ye not that ye ſhall judge the Angells,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Every one muſt needs be ſure that this is meant of the <hi>evill</hi> Angells, it cannot be meant of the good. There is ſome <hi>circumſtance</hi> alway in the Text, that points it out, when they are ſaid to be <hi>Angells.</hi> But for the <hi>holy</hi> Angells, the <hi>bleſſed</hi> Spirits, they are <hi>frequently,</hi> and generally called ſo in Scripture, for the <hi>moſt</hi> part (if not <hi>alway</hi>) when this word is <hi>ſimply</hi> met with, it is appliable to <hi>good</hi> Angells.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon is very evident, becauſe the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Angell</hi> is a name of <hi>function,</hi> by <hi>nature</hi> they are <hi>Spirits,</hi> by <hi>Office</hi> they are <hi>Angells,</hi> it is a name of <hi>Office,</hi> and function, and <hi>imployment;</hi> ſince the name of <hi>Angell</hi> is a name of that holy Office, and <hi>imployment</hi> that Gods puts them to, and ſince the <hi>good</hi> Angells are <hi>onely</hi> put by God upon <hi>ſuch</hi> imployments; the <hi>evill</hi> Angells have onely his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,</hi> and <hi>permiſſion,</hi> they have not his <hi>direction;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the name of <hi>Angell</hi> cannot properly be applied to <hi>evill</hi> Spirits, without <hi>abuſe</hi> of the name. Though they be <hi>Spirits,</hi> as the <hi>good</hi> Angells are, they are not <hi>Angells</hi> properly, by <hi>nature</hi> they are <hi>ſpirits,</hi> but by <hi>imployment, Devills,</hi> in <hi>malice</hi> Devills. But the other, as they are in <hi>nature, Spirits,</hi> ſo in <hi>imployment</hi> they are <hi>Angells.</hi> Angells, that is, <hi>holy</hi> Angells, becauſe the name is <hi>generally</hi> appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>good</hi> Angells, when there is no ſuch <hi>addition,</hi> that reaſon is ſufficient. That is one reaſon why it cannot be meant of <hi>evill</hi> Angells, but that is not all.</p>
                  <pb n="493" facs="tcp:114893:264"/>
                  <p>Another reaſon is taken from the <hi>latitude,</hi> and <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> and <hi>evill</hi> Angells. Though their <hi>knowledge</hi> be <hi>great</hi> of <hi>naturall</hi> things, and much ſtrengthened by <hi>experience;</hi> yet for the <hi>Divine</hi> Myſteries of redemption, their knowledge is altogether <hi>defective</hi> in it. They are very <hi>cunning,</hi> it is very likely, in the Scriptures, becauſe they may have them ready to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare</hi> men, but the <hi>ſaving</hi> Myſteries of the Goſpell, I make doubt whether they <hi>truely</hi> underſtand them. I am confident the Devill did not underſtand the firſt Promiſe that was given ſo long before, how the <hi>Seed of the Woman ſhould breake the Serpents head,</hi> before Chriſts <hi>Paſſion.</hi> He was not <hi>ſure</hi> that the Son of God ſhould take our <hi>nature,</hi> and that Chriſt was <hi>he,</hi> till after the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;</hi> their knowledge therefore in <hi>Divine</hi> Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is very ſhort, and they care not to better it at all, for, the more <hi>knowledge,</hi> the more is their <hi>Torment;</hi> they care not to better it, unleſſe it be for their owne <hi>ill</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that they may make that knowledge a <hi>Snare</hi> for men, and a help to <hi>temptation.</hi> See it in <hi>two</hi> great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>great</hi> help of our Redemption was, the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of Chriſt; it is the generall Tenent of the Fathers (and upon good reaſon) that the Devill was altogether <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> of it, before it was <hi>accompliſhed.</hi> Therefore St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> and <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> give this reaſon why the Devill did goe about to <hi>hinder</hi> it by all meanes, when it drew to the conſummation, becauſe then he underſtood that his <hi>power</hi> began to be <hi>aboliſhed.</hi> If the Devill had <hi>certainly knowne</hi> that by the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, his Kingdome ſhould haue beene <hi>demoliſhed,</hi> and his power <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> it is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,</hi> nay, it is <hi>certaine,</hi> that he would not have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to have ſtirred up <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Maſter; or the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> to have ſhed that innocent blood. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:114893:265"/>St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> and others obſerve, that that <hi>Dreame</hi> that <hi>Pilats</hi> Wife had concerning our Saviour, when ſhee ſaid to her Husband that he ſhould <hi>not have to doe with that juſt man,</hi> to prevent his Sentence; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the Fathers are of Opinion, that that <hi>Dreame</hi> was ſuggeſted by the <hi>Devill</hi> (though others are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinion, and upon better ground, yet that was their Opinion) that thereby he might hinder the <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> of Chriſt. And others thinke upon the ſame ground, that he was the means of inſtigation, why <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> did bring <hi>back</hi> the peices of Silver, and deliver them to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and acknowledged that he had <hi>betrayed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood,</hi> that he might <hi>ſtay</hi> the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of Chriſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he knew, or came confidently to <hi>think</hi> that he was the Son of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As he was <hi>ignorant</hi> therefore that his Kingdom ſhould be <hi>deſtroyed</hi> by the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt, ſo he was ignorant of the <hi>firſt</hi> Myſtery, Chriſts <hi>incarnaration,</hi> and our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;</hi> he was <hi>ignorant</hi> of the <hi>birth</hi> of the Son of <hi>God,</hi> that the Son of God was <hi>borne</hi> into the World; though he confeſſed oft, <hi>What have we to doe with thee, thou Jeſus the Son of God?</hi> It was a <hi>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was a <hi>doubtfull</hi> Speech, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayth, he was in great <hi>doubt,</hi> he was at a <hi>ſtand,</hi> he knew not <hi>what</hi> to think, he was <hi>blinded</hi> with the luſtre of the hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

                     <hi>union,</hi> it was a <hi>Myſtery</hi> that he could <hi>not</hi> apprehend. He could not make theſe <hi>two</hi> ends meet together, when he ſaw Chriſt in the <hi>Deſart,</hi> his long <hi>faſting,</hi> and that he was <hi>hungry</hi> in the end, he could not make theſe poſſibly <hi>meet,</hi> that theſe two ſhould ſtand together, that the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ſhould be <hi>hungry,</hi> he underſtood it <hi>not,</hi> that the Son of <hi>man</hi> ſhould <hi>faſt</hi> 40. dayes, he knew it <hi>not.</hi> He knew not the Myſtery of the hypoſtaticall <hi>union,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> He laboured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to looke <hi>into</hi> the Myſtery, becauſe he knew it <hi>not;</hi> but it was not a diſquiſition of <hi>piety</hi> that he might <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive,</hi> but of <hi>curioſity,</hi> that he might <hi>know.</hi> He laboured to <hi>prie</hi> into it, not out of <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>hope,</hi> that it might <hi>be</hi> ſo, but out of <hi>feare</hi> that it <hi>was</hi> ſo. He knew well he was to have <hi>no</hi> benefite at all by the <hi>incarnation</hi> of Chriſt, and therefore could have no <hi>love,</hi> and becauſe <hi>no</hi> love, no <hi>hope,</hi> and becauſe no <hi>hope,</hi> he deſired not to make any <hi>due</hi> inquiſition into it, he could have <hi>no</hi> deſire of it.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>deſire</hi> in the Text is a <hi>holy</hi> deſire, and a <hi>holy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, being a <hi>holy</hi> deſire, and a <hi>holy</hi> object, and a <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> inſpection, it cannot poſſibly be underſtood of the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> Angells. There is the firſt Propoſition <hi>negative,</hi> upon theſe two grounds the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Angells,</hi> and the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Devills,</hi> it cannot poſſibly be meant of <hi>evill Angells.</hi> 2ly As it cannot be meant of <hi>evill</hi> Angells, ſo, it muſt neceſſarily be meant of <hi>holy,</hi> and good Angells, that is the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Propoſition. For the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, their <hi>ſpirituall</hi> eyes are <hi>fitted,</hi> they are made <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of ſuch <hi>Myſteries.</hi> The Myſteries of <hi>faith,</hi> they <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle</hi> the eyes of <hi>evill</hi> ſpirits, they are not <hi>able</hi> to look on them, or if he <hi>could,</hi> he hath no <hi>deſire,</hi> becauſe he finds no <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> at all, in the Myſteries of Salvation. <hi>All</hi> his <hi>motion</hi> is to <hi>evill,</hi> all his <hi>contemplations</hi> are about <hi>evill,</hi> he <hi>moves</hi> onely to <hi>evill,</hi> he cannot move to <hi>good.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:114893:266"/>on the contrary, the <hi>good</hi> Angells, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it well of them, they are altogether <hi>unmovable</hi> to <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> they have onely <hi>motion</hi> to that that is <hi>good.</hi> Now here in this place, the <hi>object</hi> ſpoken of, is <hi>good,</hi> the <hi>ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> ſpoken of, is <hi>good,</hi> the <hi>deſire</hi> is <hi>good;</hi> the <hi>intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of theſe inſpectors is <hi>good;</hi> therefore theſe <hi>Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> muſt be the <hi>good</hi> Angells, for three reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the good Angells, their <hi>miniſtration</hi> was ſtill uſed about the Myſteries of our <hi>Salvation</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their miniſtration was uſed in relation of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>manner</hi> of it, in pointing out the <hi>name</hi> of Chriſt what it ſhould be. Their miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was uſed to Chriſt in the <hi>Deſart,</hi> after his <hi>Temptation</hi> was paſt: their miniſtration was uſed to Chriſt in the <hi>Garden</hi> in his <hi>Agonie,</hi> they came, and <hi>comforted</hi> him: their miniſtration was us'd about the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> of Chriſt, after his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> It being ſo, that they are <hi>imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> about the Myſteries of our Salvation, we need not wonder if they make it their <hi>ſtudy,</hi> and ſpeculation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their miniſtration was uſed in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Salvation, in the <hi>Saints</hi> that are the <hi>Members,</hi> they brought news of <hi>all</hi> theſe things, of Chriſts <hi>birth</hi> to the <hi>Shepheards;</hi> of his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to the <hi>Women,</hi> of his <hi>Aſcention</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Their miniſtration is uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Myſteries of Salvation, as far as it concernes the <hi>Saints.</hi> Therefore, ſince this is the great <hi>Errand</hi> that is given them in charge when they are ſent to the <hi>Earth;</hi> ſuch <hi>holy</hi> Meſſengers would <hi>oft</hi> think of their <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> they have great <hi>delight</hi> to contemplate theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, becauſe God hath <hi>imployed</hi> them in theſe, not onely concerning the <hi>head,</hi> but the <hi>Members.</hi> That is the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Myſteries of <hi>Salvation</hi> are things that the
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:114893:266"/>Angells have <hi>benefite</hi> by, their ſhare of <hi>comfort</hi> in. It is in the <hi>glaſſe</hi> of the <hi>incarnation</hi> of Chriſt, that they read the glorious Myſtery of their owne <hi>confirmation</hi> in grace, and <hi>happineſſe;</hi> therefore they muſt needs deſire oft to <hi>look</hi> in that <hi>glaſſe,</hi> they read ſo happy a leſſon there. It muſt needs be the <hi>good</hi> Angells that have <hi>benefit</hi> by theſe Myſteries, that are uſed to be <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to them. Then in this firſt point there are theſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> redound, beſides that that follows. When we look on the <hi>Perſons,</hi> the <hi>Angells,</hi> there are <hi>two</hi> inſtructions ariſe, I will but name them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, that it is an <hi>honourable</hi> imployment, and <hi>ſervice,</hi> and <hi>ſtudy,</hi> for a man to <hi>looke</hi> into the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> to be <hi>converſant</hi> about them; we may looke to them with <hi>honour,</hi> becauſe they are ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that <hi>befit</hi> Angells, they are <hi>angelicall</hi> notions; the Myſteries of <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>redemption,</hi> even thoſe that are <hi>revealed,</hi> they are a ſtudy that befit the ſpeculation of <hi>Angells;</hi> therefore it is a great honour for any <hi>man</hi>

                     </gap>o be buſied about them. If we had not this place to evince it by reaſon, the Propoſition is ſhewed plainly in <hi>Act.</hi> 17. Thoſe Chriſtians that are mentioned there, the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> they are called <hi>Noble</hi> by the Spirit of God, for this very purpoſe, becauſe they <hi>ſearched</hi> the Myſteries of Salvation, as they were Preached by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> They are called <hi>Noble</hi> Chriſtians becauſe they were converſant in a <hi>noble</hi> ſtudy. For this <hi>ennobles</hi> the <hi>mind,</hi> and the <hi>whole</hi> man, becauſe it <hi>leads</hi> him to <hi>glory.</hi> It ennobles the <hi>mind,</hi> becauſe it endues it with this <hi>honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> knowledge that is ſo <hi>illuſtrious,</hi> that there can be no <hi>better.</hi> There can be no <hi>better</hi> ſtudy in <hi>Heaven,</hi> for the <hi>Angells</hi> of God. They are called <hi>noble Bereans,</hi> becauſe they were converſant in <hi>this</hi> ſtudy. St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> tells us, they were not called <hi>noble</hi> of <hi>themſelve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="498" facs="tcp:114893:267"/>they had no <hi>outward</hi> nobility, but they are called ſo, for the great <hi>dilligence</hi> they uſed, in <hi>ſearching</hi> the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Let prophane <hi>Porphirius,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, be <hi>ſcandalized</hi> at the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of them, as they ſpeake; we know there are theſe <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in it that <hi>exceed</hi> the ſight of <hi>Angells;</hi> and thoſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries that are <hi>revealed,</hi> that they call <hi>ſimple,</hi> they are ſo <hi>abſtruſe,</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> that they are not <hi>unworthy</hi> the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and <hi>study</hi> of <hi>Angells.</hi> That is the firſt deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Myſteries of faith are <hi>noble</hi> things to <hi>look</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they may be looked into with <hi>honour,</hi> the <hi>Angells</hi> make them their <hi>ſtudy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> may be looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with <hi>honour;</hi> ſo they muſt be looked into with <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,</hi> and <hi>modeſty:</hi> becauſe they are <hi>angelicall</hi> ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that is, they are <hi>deep,</hi> and <hi>profound</hi> ſpeculations.

                  <p>It is with theſe <hi>Myſteries</hi> as it is with the <hi>Sun,</hi> as <hi>Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> ſayth, it is a <hi>good</hi> compariſon of him, look as it is with the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſayth he, there is <hi>ſomewhat</hi> in the <hi>Sun</hi> that you <hi>may</hi> look on, if you will be <hi>content</hi> to ſee that, you may; but there is <hi>ſomwhat</hi> in the Sun, that may <hi>not</hi> be looked
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:114893:267"/>on; if you will not <hi>ſee</hi> that you <hi>may,</hi> you ſhall ſee <hi>nothing</hi> at all: for he that looks too <hi>fixedly</hi> on the Sun, he can ſee <hi>nothing</hi> at all, he <hi>loſeth</hi> his eyes. So the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Salvation, there is <hi>ſomewhat</hi> in them that <hi>may</hi> be <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,</hi> if you will be content to <hi>underſtand</hi> thoſe things that are <hi>revealed,</hi> they <hi>may</hi> be underſtood; but if you will <hi>not</hi> be content to look on thoſe things that you <hi>may,</hi> you ſhall <hi>loſe</hi> the opportunity of underſtanding thoſe things that you <hi>might.</hi> He compares them to the <hi>Sun,</hi> to teach us to <hi>looke</hi> on theſe Myſteries with <hi>ſobriety.</hi> We may well compare it with the condition of the <hi>Moone</hi> too, as well as of the <hi>Sun.</hi> There is <hi>ſomewhat</hi> in the <hi>Moone</hi> that was never <hi>defined;</hi> all the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> with all their <hi>curious</hi> inſpections, and <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> cannot tell what is the <hi>Mole,</hi> what is the <hi>darkneſſe</hi> in the body of the <hi>Moone,</hi> what the <hi>darke</hi> part is, they cannot tell <hi>exactly.</hi> There is <hi>ſomewhat</hi> in the <hi>Moone</hi> that they <hi>cannot</hi> tell what it is, that is, the <hi>dark</hi> part of it; and there is <hi>ſomewhat</hi> that we can tell what it is, the <hi>light</hi> part; by that it affords us <hi>light</hi> to <hi>diſcerne.</hi> So, in the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Salvation, there is a <hi>dark</hi> part that is not <hi>intelligible,</hi> and there is a <hi>part</hi> that is <hi>intelligible,</hi> that we <hi>may</hi> be bold, and <hi>muſt</hi> looke into; here the <hi>inſpection</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is required, it is a <hi>holy, comfortable</hi> ſtudy, to converſe in the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But then, there is the <hi>dark</hi> part, that is <hi>non</hi>-intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, here we muſt <hi>ſhut</hi> our eyes, and ſit downe <hi>ſilent,</hi> and <hi>admire,</hi> and be <hi>comforted</hi> in this, that we <hi>cannot</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; that there is <hi>ſomething</hi> in this great worke that concernes us, that is impoſſible to be <hi>comprehended.</hi> For the parts that may be underſtood, looke on them with the <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>inſpection,</hi> but the parts that <hi>cannot</hi> be looked on, bring the <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> we muſt not <hi>ſearch,</hi> but <hi>beleive.</hi> It is <hi>enough</hi> for us to know that they <hi>cannot</hi> be
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:114893:268"/>comprehended, and God will not have them knowne. <hi>Quod deus, &amp;c.</hi> ſayth St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> let us be <hi>content</hi> to be <hi>ignorant</hi> of that that <hi>God</hi> would have us <hi>ignorant</hi> of, and ſince we could have knowne <hi>nothing</hi> of theſe Myſteries unleſſe <hi>God</hi> had <hi>revealed</hi> them, let us be <hi>content</hi> with that <hi>part</hi> that God hath <hi>revealed,</hi> and made <hi>plaine</hi> to us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe after <hi>all</hi> is done, after the inſpection of the <hi>glorious</hi> Spirits that have ſo much knowledge, yet ſtill they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more,</hi> and <hi>more,</hi> to <hi>look</hi> into them. There is <hi>ſomewhat</hi> in theſe Myſteries that will <hi>dazle</hi> the <hi>Angells,</hi> at leaſt, their <hi>beſt</hi> thoughts. That is the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing; as we may look to them with <hi>honour,</hi> ſo we muſt look into them with <hi>ſobriety,</hi> and <hi>modesty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have done with the <hi>firſt</hi> thing, <hi>who</hi> theſe <hi>Angells</hi> are that are ſpoken of here, that have this great deſire to <hi>looke</hi> into theſe Myſteries, <hi>Which things the Angells,</hi> that is, the <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> Spirits, the <hi>good</hi> Angells that are <hi>about the Throne,</hi> that are <hi>confirmed</hi> in grace.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the ſecond, and ſhall onely goe on with that at this time; that is, to ſee what are theſe <hi>good</hi> things?</p>
                  <q>Which things.</q>
                  <p>There is a great deale <hi>more</hi> difficulty in <hi>this,</hi> then the <hi>former,</hi> becauſe the doubt is made, to what this <hi>Pronoune</hi> relative hath reference. <hi>To which.</hi> The <hi>difficulties</hi> in this part are ſo <hi>many,</hi> that now I find my ſelfe in a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> there is no Scripture almoſt <hi>more</hi> difficult. And there are <hi>variations,</hi> not onely of <hi>Interpreters,</hi> but variation of <hi>Readings,</hi> that would take up almoſt the <hi>whole</hi> houre for a man to <hi>name</hi> the Authors that bring out <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>interpretations.</hi> Therefore I will not trouble you with that, I will not ſo much as gather them up together (it will be but an unuſefull point) leaſt I ſeeme to handle
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:114893:268"/>
                     <hi>Commentaries,</hi> and not the <hi>Text.</hi> I will onely <hi>touch</hi> at them in the <hi>laſt</hi> part, as they come in my way, and as they are uſefull for the underſtanding of <hi>this</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Now we look to the ſecond thing, theſe <hi>good things,</hi> there is no difficulty in the reſt. The <hi>deſire</hi> here is an <hi>ardent</hi> deſire; the <hi>inſpection</hi> is an <hi>accurate</hi> inſpection, to <hi>penetrate</hi> with a mans eyes, ſo to <hi>looke,</hi> as to look <hi>through,</hi> to make a <hi>good</hi> inſpection. The Angells that are here ſpoken of, I ſhewed to you, and made it plaine, that they are the <hi>good</hi> Angells; there is no difficulty in any of theſe three words. Well, the onely difficulty is in this word, <hi>Into which.</hi> The word is <hi>Plurall,</hi> yet all the <hi>Latine,</hi> not onely <hi>Coppies,</hi> and <hi>Tranſlations</hi> of the Bible, all, but <hi>ſome</hi> that are <hi>later;</hi> and there is no <hi>Writing</hi> of all the <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers (excepting one, or two, that is <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>) it is ſtill read <hi>In quem</hi> in the <hi>Singular</hi> number, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom.</hi> So the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> Tranſlation reads it, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>vulgar</hi> Latine; they read, <hi>On whome the Angells deſire to looke.</hi> We read, <hi>Into which the Angells deſire to looke.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Gregory</hi> applies this Scripture to <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, that the object of the Angells <hi>inſpection,</hi> it is <hi>God,</hi> underſtanding the <hi>three perſons</hi> of the Sacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>De deo, &amp;c.</hi> ſayth <hi>Gregory,</hi> theſe things are uttered concerning <hi>God,</hi> that it is upon <hi>him</hi> that the <hi>Angells</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to <hi>look.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others apply it, not to the <hi>three perſons</hi> in the ſacred Trinity, but to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in particular; that there is ſo <hi>great</hi> glory, ſuch <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And indeed there is ſome <hi>probability</hi> for this reading, for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> for the <hi>comming</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is the immediate <hi>antecedent</hi> before the Text,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:114893:269"/>the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> came downe from Heaven, and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, according to their reading, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whome the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells deſire to look.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> applies it by a way <hi>himſelfe</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he applies it in the <hi>Singular</hi> number, but to the <hi>ſecond</hi> perſon in Trinity, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Chriſt conſidered e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in his <hi>humane</hi> nature: and the reaſon is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>probable,</hi> becauſe in the Verſe before, there is <hi>twice</hi> mention of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Sufferings of Chriſt;</hi> and then followes, according to his reading, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whome the Angells deſire to looke.</hi> And if I ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low now this reading, and take it in the <hi>Singular</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and doe that <hi>injury,</hi> and wrong to the <hi>Greeke</hi> Copy; it would afford <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> very good points of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the reading is not at all <hi>diſſonant</hi> to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>faith.</hi> For certainly, the <hi>Angells</hi> deſire to look upon God, and to <hi>behold</hi> the <hi>humane</hi> nature of Chriſt, and to look upon the <hi>three</hi> perſons in the ſacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And if we ſhould applie it to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> it would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a good point of Inſtruction, whether we apply it to his <hi>humane</hi> nature, or his <hi>divine.</hi> If to his <hi>humane</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo the point is this: that,
<q>Chriſts humane nature, at the right hand of God, is made ſo glorious, that the very Angells themſelves <hi>(as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable</hi> Bede <hi>ſayth)</hi> not onely deſire to fill their eyes with the glorious beams of his Divine nature: but with that far tranſcendent excellency of glory, wherewith his humane nature is cloathed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They deſire to ſee the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>humane</hi> nature. It muſt needs argue a <hi>great</hi> deale of <hi>glory,</hi> as much as it is <hi>capable</hi> of, that is laid upon the <hi>humane</hi> nature of Chriſt, <hi>more</hi> then on the <hi>Angelicall</hi> nature, though it be not a
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:114893:269"/>
                     <hi>Spirit,</hi> that though in it ſelfe a <hi>body</hi> is not <hi>capable</hi> of ſo <hi>much</hi> glory as a <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet the <hi>humane</hi> nature of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>hypoſtaticall</hi> union, is <hi>capable</hi> of more glory then the <hi>Angells</hi> are. And it muſt needs be a <hi>greater</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe the <hi>Angells</hi> deſire to <hi>looke</hi> into it.</p>
                  <p>It is a point of great <hi>comfort</hi> to us, to conſider that our nature hath received already ſo much <hi>glory</hi> in Chriſt our head.</p>
                  <p>We know that our nature is <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>beatificall</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the <hi>Members,</hi> ſince it hath received already in ſuch <hi>abundance</hi> in Chriſt our <hi>head,</hi> it ſhall receive in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable manner; there ſhall be a great deale of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall glory upon the Saints: our <hi>nature</hi> in Chriſt is <hi>capable</hi> of glory already. That is the firſt point, if we apply it to the <hi>humane</hi> nature of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if we apply it to the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt, that the Angells look on Chriſt as <hi>God,</hi> it affords us a point of Inſtruction: that is this,
<q>There is one eſſentiall beatitude of Angells, and Saints in Heaven, of men, and Angells.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no <hi>eſſentiall</hi> difference in the beatitude of <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Angells.</hi> Chriſt ſayth in the Goſpell we ſhall be <hi>like</hi> the <hi>Angells,</hi> and be as <hi>they</hi> are. What is the <hi>eſſentiall</hi> beatitude of Angells? To <hi>look</hi> upon the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Chriſt is (as <hi>Baſile</hi> ſpeaks) the <hi>delight</hi> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells. And what is the beatitude of <hi>Saints?</hi> To <hi>look</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Son of <hi>God, We know when we ſhall appeare we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> There is our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in <hi>looking</hi> to Chriſt. What is the beatitude <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall</hi> of Angells? Chriſt tells us <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>There Angells behold the face of your heavenly Father.</hi> The <hi>face</hi> of God, the beatificall <hi>Viſion,</hi> is their beatitude. And what is
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:114893:270"/>the <hi>eſſentiall</hi> beatitude of the <hi>Saints?</hi> Chriſt tells us <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Then, here is no <hi>difference</hi> at all in the <hi>eſsentiall</hi> beatitude of the <hi>one,</hi> and of the <hi>other.</hi> Therefore the Scripture as in one place, it calls Angells our <hi>fellow</hi> Servants, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. <hi>See thou doe it not, for I am thy fellow Servant. Angells</hi> are <hi>fellow</hi> Servants with <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and fellow <hi>Ministers,</hi> and Miniſters are <hi>fellow-Angells,</hi> for ſo Miniſters are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. As they are called our <hi>fellow</hi> Servants, ſo the Saints are their <hi>fellow</hi> Angells, <hi>Heirs</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Salvation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>We are come to the firſt borne that are written in Heaven, and to an innumerable company of Angells,</hi> to enjoy the ſociety of <hi>Angells;</hi> we are <hi>fellow</hi> Heirs of the <hi>ſame</hi> Salvation: there is the <hi>ſame</hi>-Heaven for both, the <hi>ſame</hi> happineſſe for both; the <hi>ſame</hi> glory for both, the <hi>ſame</hi> inheritance for both; therefore the <hi>ſame happineſſe,</hi> becauſe the ſame <hi>inheritance.</hi> There is (ſayth St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> well) one, and the <hi>ſame</hi> inheritance of glory, for <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>us;</hi> that is, the Heavenly, <hi>immortall</hi> inheritance, ſayth he ſweetly, Heaven is the <hi>inheritance</hi> of <hi>both,</hi> which is as great to <hi>every</hi> one, as to <hi>all,</hi> and as great, and full of Roome for <hi>many,</hi> as to <hi>few.</hi> Every one hath <hi>all</hi> Heaven, that is, <hi>all bliſſe,</hi> all the inheritance, yet <hi>every</hi> man hath his ſhare, and <hi>all</hi> pertake of it. There is but <hi>one</hi> Heaven for <hi>both,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> inheritance for both; and that conſiſts in the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the Son of God; becauſe the <hi>Angells</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to look upon the Son of God; that is the ſecond deduction that is cleare; that the <hi>Angells,</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> have <hi>one</hi> beatitude. But I may not ſtand upon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is the <hi>forced</hi> meaning (yet I would not be deprived of it) for this reading goes not upon a good bottome, becauſe the Interpretation follows the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Singular</hi> number, and that is not to be found in any <hi>Greeke</hi> Coppy. As it is not ſo as it may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:114893:270"/>to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> nor ſo that it may have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the word <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or to the word <hi>God,</hi> it is not Singular, <hi>In quem, To whome,</hi> but Plurall, <hi>To which things.</hi> We muſt find it out as well as we can, it muſt be read <hi>Plurally;</hi> all the Greek Coppies are ſo, though the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> be Orthodox, and good, yet the <hi>reading</hi> will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to be read in the <hi>Singular,</hi> there muſt be a plurall <hi>antecedent,</hi> for this plurall <hi>relative.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you will aſke, as the Diſciples of Chriſt, when he told them of the famous things that were done at <hi>Jeruſalem, What</hi> things? So here, when it is ſaid, <hi>The Angells deſire to looke into theſe things. What things?</hi> How ſhall we find a <hi>plurall</hi> antecedent?</p>
                  <p>Yes, well enough; there is one plurall antecedent in the Verſe before, the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells deſire to behold.</hi> It ſtands in the Verſe before, but it may have reference to that, that the Angells, when the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt were tranſacted, they <hi>deſired</hi> to ſee it, and doe now <hi>ſtudy</hi> it. Not that they <hi>delighted</hi> to ſee the Son of <hi>God</hi> brought ſo <hi>low,</hi> they had no <hi>pleaſure</hi> in the ſufferings of Chriſt, as <hi>ſufferings,</hi> but to ſee him ſuffer <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,</hi> and <hi>victoriouſly,</hi> and to lay downe that <hi>meritorious</hi> blood, to offer that <hi>all ſufficient</hi> Sacrifice for the <hi>whole</hi> World, that was the <hi>joy,</hi> and delight of <hi>Angells;</hi> they deſired to look to the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> extends it alſo to the ſufferings of the <hi>Members</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Martyrs</hi> for Chriſt; when we are in the <hi>combate</hi> and conflict, eyther of <hi>temptation,</hi> or <hi>ſuffering</hi> for the name of Chriſt: <hi>God</hi> looks on us, <hi>Chriſt</hi> looks on us, the <hi>Angells</hi> look on us. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alludes to it, <hi>We are made a Theatre,</hi> a <hi>Spectacle to God, to Angells, and to men.</hi> It is a great <hi>ſupport</hi> in all our ſufferings, in all the afflictions that we undergoe, that in theſe afflictions the Angells are <hi>Spectators,</hi> they give
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:114893:271"/>their <hi>applauſe,</hi> and they are <hi>delighted.</hi> It is the joy of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells</hi> to ſee the <hi>Saints</hi> of God, ſuffer <hi>patiently,</hi> and <hi>conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and with <hi>confidence,</hi> and ſo, as to bring <hi>glory</hi> to the name of Chriſt. If we therefore refer it to the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt, it is a <hi>plurall</hi> antecedent, and well agrees with the plurall <hi>relative.</hi> Yet this is too ſtrait, though this be part of the object, yet this is not <hi>all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come a little nearer, there is another <hi>plurall</hi> antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this Text, and it is more <hi>generall,</hi> and more <hi>long;</hi> the things that were <hi>Preached</hi> and <hi>reported,</hi> the things that were <hi>ſpoken, Into which things the Angells deſire to looke.</hi> Here now we have it, take <hi>this</hi> clauſe, and put it to the <hi>former</hi> clauſe, then there is the <hi>latitude</hi> of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the <hi>full</hi> extent; the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>redemption</hi> that the <hi>Prophets ſearched</hi> into, and the <hi>Apoſtles Preached,</hi> thoſe the <hi>Angells deſire to looke into.</hi> The things that were <hi>Preached</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> are the ſame that the <hi>Angells</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make <hi>inſpection</hi> into. Of all the Latine Fathers, <hi>Ireneus</hi> onely, he pitcheth upon this; for ſo I call him, though there be Greek fragments that goe under his name, I know his Countrey, yet I reckon him ſo. He comes home, and applies it thus, into <hi>which things.</hi> All thoſe <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> things that God conveys to us by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> all thoſe things <hi>ſalvificall,</hi> thoſe are the things the <hi>Angells</hi> deſire to look into.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sophronius</hi> goes further, to apply it not onely to the good things of <hi>Redemption</hi> by Chriſt, but <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and the like.

                  <p>But this muſt be underſtood with a graine of Salt; for when we read of the <hi>greife</hi> of Angells, we muſt ſo underſtand it, as of greiving the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God; not that the holy Spirit is capable of ſuch an affection as <hi>griefe.</hi> ſo the <hi>Angells</hi> in that <hi>beatificall</hi> eſtate, are not capable of <hi>ſorrow</hi> in that place; there is not one <hi>drop</hi> of ſorrow comes in Heaven, there are no <hi>tears</hi> in Heaven, they ſhall never ſee <hi>tears</hi> in their <hi>eyes.</hi> But the <hi>greife</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells</hi> is thus much, to expreſſe their <hi>ſympathie</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> when <hi>we</hi> ſuffer, and their <hi>diſtaſt,</hi> and <hi>diſlike</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> when we <hi>continue</hi> in it, they are ſaid to greive at it, as we are ſaid to <hi>greive</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God.

                  <p>Becauſe it is fit for <hi>Angelicall</hi> ſtudy, we muſt look on them with <hi>ſobriety,</hi> the Angells ſet them <hi>bounds,</hi> we muſt not goe too <hi>far.</hi> That was the <hi>firſt</hi>-drop.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing was, what theſe <hi>things</hi> are in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that the <hi>Angells</hi> deſire to <hi>looke</hi> into.</p>
                  <p>I ſhewed in what Coppies the <hi>Singular</hi> number is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>into whome,</hi> the Greeke <hi>into which,</hi> the ſame <hi>good</hi> things that are ſet downe in the foregoing words, the good things <hi>teſtified</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> from Heaven, <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi> by the <hi>Prophets</hi> before, and <hi>reported</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is in one word ſummarily; the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> thoſe are the things they deſire to looke into.</p>
                  <p>In particular, they are <hi>high</hi> ſpeculations that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells</hi> looke into.</p>
                  <p>They are <hi>delightfull,</hi> and plauſible arguments, there are no <hi>ſad</hi> thoughts come into the <hi>Angells</hi> hearts, they ſtudy no <hi>ſorrowfull</hi> ſubject whatſoever.</p>
                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:114893:276"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are all things that concerne <hi>Salvation;</hi> the Angells thoughts run upon nothing elſe (though they <hi>enjoy</hi> Salvation) either in the <hi>glorifying</hi> of God for their <hi>owne,</hi> or in <hi>ſtriving</hi> to be <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to God in the <hi>furthering</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> their thoughts are upon <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, they are <hi>brotherly</hi> ſpeculations. The Angells <hi>have</hi> the good things they looke to with <hi>us,</hi> they are <hi>theirs,</hi> and <hi>ours,</hi> nay, more properly <hi>ours,</hi> then <hi>theirs,</hi> they are not drawne by theſe meanes, they were <hi>confirmed</hi> in an <hi>inſtant,</hi> we are drawne by <hi>degrees.</hi> This is the ſum of the two firſt parts in the forenoone.</p>
                  <p>There is but one behind, which is the maine, and will prove the longeſt; that is, to ſee, <hi>Quae radix deſiderij,</hi> what is the <hi>Originall,</hi> and ground of this holy <hi>deſire,</hi> that the <hi>Angells</hi> have to <hi>looke</hi> into theſe <hi>ſublime,</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Myſteries, to make them the object of their ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; except we find out this, we find out nothing. Becauſe there are many things queſtionable, ſeeing oft times, inquiſition comes from curioſity, or from want of <hi>deſire,</hi> or from <hi>ignorance,</hi> and the <hi>Angelicall</hi> nature is not ſubject to theſe defects, they are not <hi>curious</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into that that is <hi>concealed</hi> from them, and they are not <hi>defective</hi> in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of any thing that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them to know: therefore upon this Wheele the whole frame will turne, to find out the ground, and Originall of the deſire of the Angells, why they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with ſo holy, and <hi>impetuous</hi> motion, to looke to thoſe Myſteries, that though they be Myſteries of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and ſo <hi>above</hi> them, yet as they are things tending to <hi>Salvation,</hi> ſo they are <hi>beneath</hi> them; why the Angells are carried with ſuch <hi>affection</hi> to beſtow their <hi>ſpeculations</hi> upon theſe <hi>Myſteries,</hi> that is the thing I am to ſpeake of, at this time. That I may doe it throughly, I will goe in the Philoſophers method, he that will fill his hand
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:114893:276"/>muſt <hi>empty</hi> it, and he that will ſet downe the <hi>true</hi> cauſes, muſt remove all <hi>falſe</hi> pretended cauſes, there muſt be a <hi>paring</hi> away of all <hi>weake,</hi> and <hi>tottering</hi> foundations, that there may be a <hi>firme</hi> foundation laid, therefore this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I will proceed in.</p>
                  <p>I will firſt ſhew thoſe <hi>falſe</hi> grounds, and <hi>Originalls,</hi> that are pretended, and there I ſhall touch (though I would not dwell upon them) the <hi>miſconſtructions</hi> that are made of this Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And then I will ſet downe in order, briefly, the <hi>true</hi> grounds, and <hi>Originalls,</hi> and they are more then one. In this method I will goe.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I will remove that that is <hi>vile,</hi> to <hi>ſeperate</hi> it as <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Winnow</hi> the <hi>Chaffe</hi> from the <hi>Wheate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Looke firſt upon the <hi>Chaffe,</hi> there are <hi>falſe</hi> grounds and Originalls pretended; and they may be reduced to foure heads, otherwiſe, I can hardly find a fifth, I thinke.</p>
                  <p>Either <hi>curioſity,</hi> that that might be a ground to deſire to looke further then was revealed to them.</p>
                  <p>Or <hi>feare,</hi> that might be the ground, they were afraid they ſhould not be found <hi>faithfull</hi> in their ſervice, and ſpeculation.</p>
                  <p>Or <hi>envy,</hi> that might be the ground, that they look to them, as <hi>maligning</hi> the happy eſtate of <hi>man,</hi> that he was placed in, that all this <hi>excellent</hi> proviſion, ſhould be for the Salvation of <hi>man</hi> onely.</p>
                  <p>Or <hi>ignorance,</hi> that might be the cauſe, that becauſe they are <hi>barred</hi> of ſome <hi>knowledge,</hi> that it may be was neceſſary, therefore deſiring to come to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this <hi>excellent</hi> knowledge, they deſire to know theſe things. Looke upon them once againe more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
                  <p>The firſt falſe ground pretended, is <hi>feare</hi> that they
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:114893:277"/>ſhould not be found <hi>faithfull</hi> in their <hi>miniſtration,</hi> that was the fancy of <hi>Origen,</hi> though a very learned man, and of great antiquity, and of noble memoriall, yet it was the fancy he propounded to himſelfe, in his 11. Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie on the Booke of <hi>Numbers.</hi> The <hi>Angells</hi> deſire to looke into the Myſteries of <hi>Salvation,</hi> for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>feare</hi> that elſe they ſhould be found <hi>negligent;</hi> and ſince they are put in truſt, to <hi>Miniſter</hi> to thoſe that are <hi>heires</hi> of Salvation, and that they in their kind, were to <hi>cooperate</hi> to mans Salvation, and that the Apoſtles, and Prophets had taken ſo great pains; the Apoſtles in making <hi>knowne</hi> the Myſteries of the Goſpell, hence came the <hi>Angells</hi> inſpection, they were <hi>afraid</hi> they ſhould be <hi>exceeded</hi> in their ſervice, and imployment, by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and they ſhould be found <hi>ſloathfull,</hi> and not ſo dilligent every way, as God required of them, and ſo they ſhould come to be <hi>judged</hi> by the Apoſtles, and Saints, at the laſt day, according to that place, <hi>Know ye not that ye ſhall judge the Angells.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I call this a meere <hi>fancy,</hi> becauſe there are two <hi>rotten</hi> Pillars it ſtands on.</p>
                  <p>One, that it ſuppoſeth that the <hi>Angells</hi> that are <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> in grace, can poſſibly be <hi>ſloathfull,</hi> and <hi>idle</hi> in their performance.</p>
                  <p>Another, that it ſuppoſeth thus much, that the holy Angells, that as they are confirmed in <hi>grace,</hi> ſo in <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that they can be called to account at the laſt day, and be <hi>ſubject</hi> to any judgement, theſe things are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of all, and granted, and demonſtrated out of Scripture, that gives them the <hi>title,</hi> of <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>elect</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and Angells of <hi>light,</hi> they are grounds demonſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in Scripture, the Angells, as they are confirmed in <hi>grace,</hi> ſo in <hi>happineſſe;</hi> being confirmed in <hi>happineſſe,</hi> they are not liable to <hi>account;</hi> being confirmed in <hi>grace,</hi>
                     <pb n="519" facs="tcp:114893:277"/>there is no feare that they ſhould be <hi>unfaithfull.</hi> Nay, howſoever, the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and Apoſtles, were the moſt <hi>faithfull</hi> Servants of Chriſt, and went beyond all men whatſoever, yet <hi>their</hi> fidelity comes far <hi>ſhort</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, for there was <hi>humane</hi> frailty mingled with them: St. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth it, that <hi>laboured more abundantly then all.</hi> There was no <hi>feare</hi> of the Angells, that they ſhould be <hi>judged</hi> by the Apoſtles, becauſe they were <hi>leſſe</hi> faithfull then they. This is a meere <hi>fancy,</hi> and <hi>dreame,</hi> therefore the firſt ground cannot ſtand, that is wronge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let us looke on another.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Originall, or ground pretended, is, that it might be out of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urioſity,</hi> that being <hi>knowing</hi> Spirits, very inquiſitive to know ſomwhat further then was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them. To this head we may refer that other fancy of <hi>Turian,</hi> and <hi>Salmer,</hi> that were both Birds of a Popiſh feather, that are of opinion, that the things that the Angells deſire to <hi>looke</hi> into ſo much, they are the myſteries of Chriſts <hi>preſence</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> they look into the Myſteries of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to ſee Chriſts Body <hi>carnally</hi> preſent there, under the Elements of <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine. Sameron</hi> the Jeſuite, quotes <hi>Gregory</hi> for it; there is nothing tending to that purpoſe there. Indeed, he ſpeaks as other of the Fathers, of the preſence of the <hi>Angells</hi> in the Church of God, when we are converſant about myſteries, but not to looke to <hi>that</hi> (eſpecially that is not) that the Angells make the object of their ſpeculation, <hi>a non entitie,</hi> the Angells are not ſo <hi>ignorant,</hi> the Angells rejoyce when they ſee the <hi>true</hi> adoration, &amp; ſincere worſhip given to God; but one the other ſide, they greive, and <hi>ſhut</hi> their eyes, when they ſee Gods glory given to <hi>Creatures,</hi> as it is by them. The Angells are not <hi>curious,</hi> to looke into things <hi>ſecret,</hi> they will not greatly be delighted with <hi>ſuperstitions</hi> that will vaniſh.
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:114893:278"/>That could not be the ground, <hi>curioſity,</hi> I call that not onely a <hi>fancy,</hi> but a <hi>folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third pretended ground is, that it muſt be out of <hi>envie,</hi> or <hi>malignity,</hi> they had to man; becauſe that all this <hi>excellent</hi> proviſion was onely for <hi>mans</hi> Salvation. Howſoever, the Angells are <hi>confirmed</hi> in grace, and ſo had by <hi>one</hi> communication, all thoſe good things that are diſpenſed to <hi>us</hi> by many; yet there is more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods goodneſſe to <hi>man,</hi> then appeared to <hi>Angells,</hi> more manifeſtation in regard of the <hi>effect.</hi> And that it is, that that was <hi>Phillippus Solitarius,</hi> one of the Ancients, the reaſon why the Angells make inſpection into the Myſteries of <hi>Salvation,</hi> it is this, becauſe they are not <hi>well</hi> pleaſed that all thoſe <hi>priviledges</hi> ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon <hi>man.</hi> Therefore, ſayth he, we muſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it thus, they deſire to <hi>looke into,</hi> that is, to <hi>enter</hi> into theſe things, to <hi>partake</hi> of them; they deſire that Chriſt would <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>aſſume</hi> their nature, as he is in <hi>mans</hi> nature, they deſire that they may have the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>keys</hi> given <hi>them,</hi> as it was to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>greateſt</hi> evill of the reſt, to ſuppoſe ſuch an <hi>irregularity,</hi> that they ſhould deſire <hi>more</hi> honour then God hath given them, and that they ſhould <hi>envy</hi> man. No, theſe two, <hi>envy,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> were the ſins of the <hi>evill</hi> Angells, that is ſet downe by the joynt conſent of all ancient Writers. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> may ſpeake for all, they <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied</hi> man <hi>ſtanding,</hi> or <hi>raiſed,</hi> becauſe <hi>themſelves</hi> were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. Sayth St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> againe, they <hi>envied</hi> that <hi>man</hi> ſhould be made after the <hi>Image</hi> of God. <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> were the ſins of the <hi>evill</hi> Angells; ſhall any be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy as to think that the <hi>good</hi> Angells are incident to thoſe <hi>ill</hi> affections, that did caſt the bad Angells out of <hi>Heaven?</hi> Therefore the third ground and Originall falls of it <hi>ſelfe</hi> too. As it was not out of <hi>curioſity,</hi> ſo it
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:114893:278"/>was not out of <hi>envy,</hi> at the good of man. They <hi>rejoyce</hi> at the good of man, and at the <hi>converſion</hi> of <hi>ſinners,</hi> they could not have an <hi>envious</hi> diſpoſition for any <hi>good</hi> to him. I am almoſt at an end of this firſt part: there is one thing behind, that is,</p>
                  <p>The fourth pretended, falſe Originall, that it might be out of <hi>ignorance,</hi> becauſe theſe Myſteries of Salvation were concealed from the Angells a long time before, and even now, in a great part, therefore out of the ſence, and apprehenſion of their <hi>want</hi> in this particular, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour more and more, to <hi>looke</hi> into theſe Myſteries. As if thoſe <hi>glorious</hi> Creatures that are, and alway have beene from their <hi>firſt</hi> confirmation, in actuall fruition of everlaſting <hi>beatitude,</hi> ſhould be ſubject to any <hi>want</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>happineſſe,</hi> every way anſwerable to their <hi>eſtate,</hi> and <hi>nature.</hi> Yet this miſconſtruction diverſe of the Fathers made of theſe words. Though it be an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, yet there is a little reſpect to be given to their <hi>obliquities,</hi> becauſe they were ſuch <hi>excellent</hi> lights; yet in matter of inſpection I know nothing that they erre more in. For it is worth obſerving, there are <hi>two</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Angells,</hi> of the Myſteries of <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One was this, that the Angells knew not the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Redemption,</hi> before the things were <hi>accompliſhed, Jerome, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome, Nulli angelo, &amp;c.</hi> ſayth <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> it is a thing that was not revealed to any <hi>Angell,</hi> or <hi>Ark-Angell,</hi> or any <hi>power</hi> created, before it was brought to <hi>paſſe;</hi> and they ground it upon <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. and <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 1. Where the Apoſtle ſayth, that God <hi>ſince hath make knowne the Myſtery that was hid from Ages, and Generations.</hi> Whereas, if a man conſider of the place well, he ſhall find that place rather <hi>refutes</hi> it, then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to it. The Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Theſe Myſteries were had
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:114893:279"/>from the beginning of the World, from Ages, and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> He ſpeaks of <hi>men, Angells</hi> are not ſubject to <hi>Ages,</hi> and <hi>Generations,</hi> it is out of the Angelicall ſpheare, ages, and Generations, they wax not old, there is no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there is no Child-hood, or old age of Angells, there are no Generations neyther: every Angell makes a <hi>ſpecies,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> number of Angells was created at <hi>once,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, it was hid from <hi>Ages,</hi> and <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> that is, from <hi>men,</hi> yet not <hi>altogether</hi> from men, they had ſo much that they might ground upon; it was not revealed <hi>fully,</hi> but that ſpeaks not of <hi>Angells</hi> at all; but yet out of that reſpect to men that were learned. Doctor <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> diſtinction will help, that is, the <hi>Angells</hi> did not <hi>underſtand</hi> theſe Myſteries by a <hi>naturall,</hi> concreated <hi>knowledge,</hi> but by a <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> ſuper-infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they had not the knowledge from the firſt inſtant of their <hi>Creation,</hi> but from the firſt inſtant of their <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in grace, it is ſuper-added.</p>
                  <p>Againe, though they knew theſe things in <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> yet not every particular <hi>circumſtance,</hi> till they were <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed;</hi> becauſe their <hi>experimentall</hi> knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <hi>degrees,</hi> it is <hi>intended,</hi> and <hi>growes</hi> greater, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it by <hi>experience,</hi> it growes greater, that is the firſt opinion of the Ancients, concerning the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Angells.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is this, as they knew <hi>not</hi> the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of redemption, ſo they learned by the <hi>Church</hi> of God, that they learned the <hi>knowledge</hi> of theſe Myſteries from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that Preached, and daily <hi>now</hi> from the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> ſo all the ſtreame of the Ancient run. St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> ſayth they are <hi>Auditors</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>learne</hi> the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Salvation, they <hi>learne</hi> it by the knowledge they get in the <hi>Church, Jerome, Gregory Nycene</hi> (to name no more) they ground it upon <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:114893:279"/>
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the Myſteries of Salvation that were hidden before, about Verſ. 10. <hi>To the end, that to principallities and powers, might be made knowne in the Church, the wonderfull wiſdome of God.</hi> Hence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that therefore, becauſe the Apoſtle ſayth, that thoſe Myſteries are made <hi>knowne to principallities in the Church,</hi> that they were preſent at thoſe Sermons, to learne fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thoſe Myſteries, eſpecially at the Sermons of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that they might be <hi>inſtructed</hi> in the <hi>profundity,</hi> and <hi>height,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and ſpeculation of them, ſo they come to Sermons as <hi>Auditors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But indeed St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> that handles the queſtion, and the place well, he ſhews that that place cannot be wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch a conſtruction, though he gives three Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. Sayth St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (it is worth obſerving) that the Apoſtle ſayth, to make knowne to the Angells in the Church; he ſayth not, in <hi>our</hi> Church; In the Church <hi>tryumphant,</hi> there they make <hi>knowne;</hi> there is St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> owne interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Againe, ſayth he, one word expounds another, they were <hi>hid</hi> from <hi>men,</hi> but ſo, as they were <hi>knowne</hi> to <hi>An-Angells,</hi> ſo as they were made knowne by God to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,</hi> but not juſt <hi>then,</hi> when they were made knowne to <hi>men.</hi>

                  <p>But if this will not ſuffice, the place it ſelfe makes it cleare, that there cannot be ſuch a conſtruction wrung out of thoſe words, the Apoſtle ſpeaks, of the <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment</hi> of the Myſteries, they indeed are made <hi>knowne</hi> to <hi>Angells,</hi> by the <hi>Church,</hi> he ſpeaks not of the <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> the Angells could not ſee Chriſt <hi>borne,</hi> till he <hi>was</hi> borne, and a Sinner <hi>converted,</hi> till he be <hi>converted:</hi> ſo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, they ſee daily in the Church the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of theſe Myſteries, ſo there is an <hi>addition</hi> to their <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi> knowledge, not to their <hi>intuitive;</hi> they ſaw by
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:114893:280"/>the Preaching of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that the fullneſſe of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was comming in, that the Myſtery of Salvation was to be accompliſhed, that it was done in the <hi>Church</hi> by the Apoſtles; they ſaw that <hi>ſinners</hi> were <hi>converted,</hi> and that the number of the Saints was to be <hi>conſummate,</hi> becauſe God caſt out the <hi>Net,</hi> and brought them home daily, doe they therefore learne at our <hi>Sermons?</hi> No, it is too high an hyperbole, and <hi>abaſing</hi> of the <hi>Angelicall</hi> nature; the Saints in <hi>Heaven</hi> that have not that full meaſure of the <hi>beatitude,</hi> that they ſhall at the <hi>laſt;</hi> the Saints that have a <hi>leſſe</hi> meaſure of knowledge, then the <hi>Angells,</hi> for they are not <hi>capable</hi> of ſo much, yet <hi>their</hi> knowledge is far more <hi>perfect</hi> then ours is; nay then the knowledge of any of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> though they had the <hi>gifts</hi> of the holy Ghoſt. The knowledge of the Saints in Heaven, is ſuch, that they need not come to learne of <hi>us,</hi> and ſhall the <hi>Angells?</hi> The Angells are thoſe, that God alway uſed their imployment in the <hi>accompliſhing</hi> of theſe Myſteries; they were imployed by God about Chriſt; they were preſent with Chriſt in the <hi>Garden,</hi> at the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, at his <hi>reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>aſcenſion,</hi> and could they be ignorant of them, that they muſt come to <hi>learne</hi> of the <hi>Apostles?</hi> The <hi>Angells</hi> were uſed to <hi>carry</hi> glad tidings, <hi>propheticall</hi> to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and the glad tidings of Chriſt after, when he came in the fleſh; the firſt tidings of his <hi>conception,</hi> they carryed that. They were, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks, the <hi>firſt</hi> Pen men, at leaſt the firſt <hi>ſpokeſ-men</hi> of the Goſpell, the very word <hi>Evangelium</hi> came from them firſt, it was taken out of <hi>their</hi> name, it is but a <hi>ſillable</hi> more then that that is in their owne; they were the firſt <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and dictatours of the Goſpell, and were they ignorant of the Myſteries of it?</p>
                  <p>It is well obſerved by <hi>Baſile,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> the one is <hi>Baſiles</hi> word, the other is <hi>Chryſoſtomes:</hi> that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells</hi>
                     <pb n="525" facs="tcp:114893:280"/>are to <hi>men</hi> as <hi>Teachers,</hi> and Inſtructers, as <hi>Guardians;</hi> and Keepers to <hi>men,</hi> ſhall they be our <hi>Schollers</hi> and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pills? It is a diſhonour to the excellent <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of Angells, to come to <hi>learne</hi> at our Sermons. I the rather proſecute <hi>this,</hi> becauſe many Interpret it ſo; I take it to be a great abuſe. The Angells have that meaſure of knowledge, that they neede not <hi>our</hi> help, nor the help of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> though there be Myſteries in the Scripture, that they cannot <hi>ſound;</hi> yet for <hi>beatifical</hi> knowledge, they have it to the <hi>full, joy,</hi> and <hi>holyneſſe,</hi> and all to the full, there cannot be a <hi>drop</hi> added more to that they have already; they are preſent ſometimes in the Congregation, therefore the Apoſtle bids us <hi>carry</hi> our ſelves <hi>decently,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Angells. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreverent</hi> carriage, whatſoever we thinke of it, is a <hi>griefe</hi> to the <hi>Angells;</hi> but they are preſent as <hi>Spectators,</hi> not as <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pills; that ground is fallen, they could not deſire it out of <hi>ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have done with the falſe grounds, not out of <hi>feare,</hi> not out of <hi>curioſity,</hi> not out of <hi>envy,</hi> not out of <hi>ignorance:</hi> Now I ſhall goe on ſmoothly; when the hand is empty, it may be filled againe.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the <hi>true</hi> cauſe, the <hi>true</hi> Originall, whence this deſire of this ſpeculation comes.</p>
                  <p>This muſt be <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> therefore, as a thing to be taken for granted, that as it is a <hi>beatificall object,</hi> and a beatificall <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> ſo they are carried to this object with a <hi>beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall</hi> Apetite, and <hi>deſire,</hi> and a beatificall <hi>ſpecies</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites this Apetite in theſe Angells. It cannot be an <hi>ill</hi> ground, there can be no <hi>ſiniſter</hi> reſpect, it muſt be a <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> and ſimply a <hi>pious</hi> ground. As the other were <hi>fowre,</hi> ſo I will reduce this to <hi>fowre</hi> heads that will afford foure parts, that is the ſum of that I ſhall ſpeake at this time.</p>
                  <pb n="526" facs="tcp:114893:281"/>
                  <p>The firſt ground of their deſire is from <hi>admiration,</hi> for <hi>beholding</hi> the Myſteries of our <hi>redemption,</hi> they <hi>admire</hi> Gods <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and they deſire to <hi>admire</hi> againe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, therefore though they looke into them daily, and ſee what is fit to be knowne, yet they deſire a <hi>greater</hi> rapture that they may <hi>admire</hi> God <hi>more</hi> in them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſtill deſire more, that they may <hi>bleſſe</hi> God. So <hi>Calvin</hi> interprets the words very well, <hi>Mirari dicuntur, &amp;c.</hi> that they <hi>looke</hi> into theſe <hi>Myſteries,</hi> it ſprings from <hi>wonderment,</hi> from a holy <hi>aſtoniſhment,</hi> and <hi>Extaſy:</hi> the happineſſe of <hi>Heaven</hi> is all <hi>Extaſy;</hi> howſoever the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Saints below,</hi> carried them <hi>out</hi> of <hi>themſelves,</hi> yet thoſe Extaſies <hi>perfect</hi> the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> they carry not a man <hi>beyond</hi> himſelfe, there is alway an Extaſy of <hi>Admiration;</hi> and alway where there is <hi>admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they will <hi>looke, admiration</hi> and wonderment breed <hi>inſpection;</hi> ſee it in many inſtances.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles when they ſaw our bleſſed Saviour <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend</hi> into Heaven, they were ſtricken with <hi>aſtoniſhment,</hi> and that cauſed them to gaze, <hi>They looked ſtedfaſtly to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> ſayth the Text, ſo the Angells apply it to them, <hi>Why ſtand ye gazing?</hi> they were <hi>amazed,</hi> therfore they <hi>lookt</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, they followed him with their eyes. <hi>Amazement</hi> breeds <hi>looking:</hi> So in <hi>Luke</hi> 4. when Chriſt was at <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> and came into the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> he tooke the Booke of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> into his hands, and it is ſaid Verſ. 20. <hi>The eyes of all that were preſent, were fixed on him:</hi> And what was the reaſon? At Verſ. 22. <hi>They wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth,</hi> therefore their eyes were <hi>fixed</hi> upon him. <hi>Admiration</hi> breeds <hi>fixing</hi> of the <hi>eyes:</hi> Whatſoever a man <hi>wonders</hi> at, he <hi>looks</hi> at; <hi>admiration</hi> it draws the eye alway to the object; ſo here, the <hi>Angells</hi> becauſe they are taken with a holy <hi>admiration</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of theſe Myſteries, though they doe <hi>alway</hi> look
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:114893:281"/>into them, yet they deſire <hi>ſtill</hi> that they may be ſtricken with <hi>more</hi> admiration.</p>
                  <p>See it plainly by <hi>particulars,</hi> if we ſpeak of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the <hi>paſſion</hi> of Chriſt, the Angells were ſtricken with <hi>admiration</hi> at that, they were <hi>greatly</hi> aſtoniſhed; therefore <hi>Jerome</hi> applies that place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. <hi>Who is he that comes from Edom, with died Garments from Bozra?</hi> He applies it to the <hi>admiration</hi> of the <hi>Angells,</hi> this very Scripture was <hi>uttered</hi> when they ſaw Chriſt ſhed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>blood</hi> upon the Croſſe, they ſpake it with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Who is he that comes from Edom, with red Garments from Bozra?</hi> They <hi>admired</hi> at the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the <hi>ſuffering</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>So they were ſtricken with <hi>admiration</hi> at the <hi>aſcention</hi> of Chriſt, though they ſaid to the Diſciples, <hi>Why gaze yee?</hi> They <hi>admired</hi> as well as the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but they were better able to carry it, but they <hi>admired;</hi> for St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and other of the Fathers, ſay, that the 24. Pſalme was made on purpoſe to expreſſe the <hi>admiration</hi> of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,</hi> at the <hi>aſcention</hi> of Chriſt. <hi>Be ye ſet open ye everlaſting gates that the King of glory may come in.</hi> When Chriſt <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,</hi> the <hi>Angells</hi> ſung this Song; and St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is of Opinion, that they anſwered one another, as in a <hi>Quire,</hi> one Quire ſings, and aſks the <hi>Queſtion</hi> out of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, Who is the King of glory?</hi> The other <hi>anſwered</hi> them, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is the King of glory;</hi> they were ſtricken with <hi>admiration</hi> of Chriſts <hi>aſcention,</hi> therefore they looked. So <hi>Cyril</hi> on that place, and ſo here being ſtricken with the <hi>Amazement</hi> of Gods goodneſſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſire to looke.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe that we are to make of it for our Inſtruction, is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it tells us that the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Salvation muſt needs be <hi>great</hi> Myſteries that put the <hi>Angells</hi> into a <hi>rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                     <pb n="528" facs="tcp:114893:282"/>that breeds the <hi>admiration</hi> of <hi>Angells.</hi> It exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly magnifies the <hi>excellency</hi> of the Goſpell of Chriſt, that it muſt needs be an <hi>excellent</hi> Goſpell that conteins in it <hi>ſuch</hi> Myſteries, the <hi>Angells</hi> themſelves ſtand <hi>astoniſhed</hi> at; it conteins ſuch Myſteries as are moſt <hi>deſirable</hi> of the <hi>Angells,</hi> as draw the <hi>eyes</hi> of <hi>Angells</hi> after them, as put the <hi>Angells</hi> to an <hi>Extaſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Uſe of it in the ſecond place is this, to <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> them in this particular; above all things learne to <hi>admire</hi> Gods <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> revealed to <hi>man</hi> in Chriſt; we are called upon in Scripture to be <hi>thankfull,</hi> and to walk <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable</hi> to it, and they are <hi>good</hi> Uſes, but we cannot make you, unleſſe we be ſtricken with <hi>admiration.</hi> If a man doe not firſt <hi>admire</hi> Gods goodneſſe in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Chriſt to the Church, he cannot be thankfull; and the reaſon why there is ſo <hi>little thankfullneſſe,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſo little <hi>admiration;</hi> that that <hi>dazles</hi> the eyes of <hi>Angells,</hi> is but <hi>ordinary</hi> in our <hi>eyes,</hi> becauſe theſe things are <hi>daily</hi> propounded: therefore ſince the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls upon us to celebrate Gods <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and we cannot celebrate it without <hi>thankfullneſſe,</hi> and we cannot be <hi>thankfull</hi> without <hi>admiration,</hi> if we admire we ſhall draw our <hi>eyes</hi> after it, if we <hi>admire</hi> Gods goodneſſe, our <hi>eyes</hi> will be lift to thoſe <hi>Hills,</hi> ſo to <hi>bleſſe</hi> him, and to <hi>pray</hi> that we may have the <hi>Comfort</hi> in our owne hearts. That is the <hi>firſt</hi> ground, and there is the firſt Leſſon to us, it <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is</hi> out of admiration, the Angells deſire to look into thoſe <hi>Myſteries,</hi> as they deſired in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time, ſo <hi>ſtill,</hi> and to the <hi>Worlds</hi> end.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>Radix</hi> whence this deſire comes, is from <hi>expectation;</hi> for <hi>expectation</hi> is the <hi>Whetſtone</hi> of <hi>deſire:</hi> ſo it is that <hi>Didimus Alexandrinus</hi> Expounds theſe words, that the Angells being abundantly well <hi>pleaſed,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,</hi> and <hi>rejoycing</hi> in the accompliſhment of thoſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:114893:282"/>that are already <hi>paſt;</hi> they look to theſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>ſtill</hi> out of <hi>expectation</hi> of that is <hi>behind,</hi> for there is ſomewhat to be <hi>accompliſhed,</hi> which till it be done, the <hi>Angells</hi> themſelves have not the higheſt pitch of their <hi>happineſſe,</hi> till all be gathered to the <hi>tryumphant</hi> body, there is <hi>ſomewhat</hi> to be <hi>accompliſhed,</hi> and that the Angells are in <hi>expectation</hi> of, and out of <hi>expectation,</hi> they deſire, <hi>looking</hi> to thoſe <hi>things,</hi> ſayth <hi>Didimus,</hi> that are to <hi>be</hi> done, and brought to <hi>paſſe</hi> in the <hi>end</hi> of the World; and St. <hi>Barnard</hi> expounds theſe words, the <hi>Angells</hi> deſire to look, to the time of <hi>reſtitution,</hi> that that time may <hi>haſten,</hi> and come about, that there may be an <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of the number of the <hi>elect,</hi> and all the gracious <hi>promiſes</hi> that God hath revealed in his word, this they deſire, and looke to, ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> well, they deſire to ſee the <hi>accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of all thoſe <hi>good</hi> things they have ſeen <hi>accompliſhed</hi> in the <hi>greateſt</hi> part. In the part that is <hi>behind,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the accompliſhment of that, and out of that <hi>expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> they <hi>looke</hi> into theſe Myſteries. That is another ground.</p>
                  <p>And it goes upon good reaſon, for <hi>expectation</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way carry the <hi>eye,</hi> as well as <hi>admiration:</hi> alway <hi>longing</hi> breeds <hi>looking:</hi> So in Judg. 5. the Mother of <hi>Siſera</hi> ſhee <hi>expected</hi> her Sons tryumphant returne, ſhee <hi>looked out of the Window, and ſaid, why is his Chariot ſo long in comming?</hi> Therefore ſhee looked to ſee if ſhee could <hi>ſpie</hi> him: So in that place, <hi>John</hi> 8. concerning <hi>Abraham, Abraham de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee my day, and ſaw it, and rejoyced.</hi> The <hi>expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the accompliſhment of the promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> made <hi>Abraham looke</hi> ſtill to be carried with a holy <hi>deſire</hi> that it might be <hi>accompliſhed.</hi> So <hi>Symeon, Luke</hi> 2. when Chriſt was preſent in the Temple; <hi>Symeon</hi> had <hi>long waited for the conſolation of Iſrael,</hi> therefore when he came and ſaw Chriſt, he could not turne his eyes off
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:114893:283"/>him; the reaſon why he fixed his <hi>eyes</hi> on Chriſt, was, becauſe he had long waited for the accompliſhment of that day; therefore <hi>expectation</hi> made him ſet his <hi>eyes</hi> on him; ſo becauſe the Angells are ſtill in <hi>expectation</hi> of the accompliſhment of that, that is not yet finiſhed, therefore they <hi>looke</hi> to theſe Myſteries: And the point is this, it ſhall be the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the grace of <hi>hope,</hi> that hope, though it be the grace of the <hi>way,</hi> yet hope in part is a grace of the <hi>Countrey;</hi> hope is a <hi>glorious</hi> grace in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to us with the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> for the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were ſtil in <hi>expectation</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> comming of Chriſt, as <hi>we</hi> are of his ſecond. Nay, it's a grace <hi>common</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> not onely with <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> but to us with <hi>Angells,</hi> the Angells themſelves are ſtill in <hi>hope,</hi> there is ſomething that is the object of <hi>hope</hi> in <hi>Angells,</hi> that is the fullfilling of thoſe Promiſes that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath reſerved to be fullfilled to the <hi>laſt</hi> times, the ſecond comming of Chriſt to Judgement, that ſhall put an <hi>end,</hi> and period to theſe ſecular days of <hi>miſery</hi> in this World, and turne <hi>all</hi> days into <hi>one,</hi> that glorious day, the <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Angells</hi> in Heaven are ſtill in <hi>expectation</hi> of; therefore becauſe that is the <hi>comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the Myſteries of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore the Angells deſire to look into them; that as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, it is <hi>finiſhed</hi> on the Croſſe, before he gave up the Ghoſt to the work of our <hi>redemption, paſſive,</hi> ſo to the worke of <hi>faith,</hi> there ſhall be ſuch a word pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the laſt day; till then we live by <hi>hope,</hi> and we need not be <hi>aſhamed, Hope maketh not aſhamed,</hi> it is an <hi>excellent grace, common</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> to <hi>Angells.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a thing to be <hi>deplored</hi> in Chriſtianity (and I will take order to remedy it as much as I can) that among all other graces in Chriſtianity, the grace of <hi>hope</hi> is ſo <hi>little</hi> ſpoken of, when did you heare in a Sermon <hi>hope</hi> ſpoken of to <hi>purpoſe?</hi> One of the <hi>three</hi> Siſters is almoſt
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:114893:283"/>
                     <hi>juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>led</hi> out of the World, it is the twine ofaith, they hang upon <hi>each</hi> others ſhoulders, faith makes preſent, hope ſtaies with patience; all the comfort of a Chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon <hi>hope;</hi> it is lamentable that ſo eminent a grace ſhould never be thought of, we know not what it is to live by <hi>hope: faith</hi> is that grace, it is true, that is to be <hi>magnified,</hi> but the ſetting up of that excellent grace of faith, hath almoſt drowned this grace of <hi>hope;</hi> while there is any thing to be <hi>fullfilled,</hi> we live by <hi>hope,</hi> and we need not be <hi>aſhamed,</hi> it is common to <hi>us,</hi> with <hi>Angells:</hi> Nay, it is proper to <hi>us</hi> more then to <hi>them,</hi> for when we come to fruition, perfect <hi>fruition, hope</hi> ceaſeth; when there is no <hi>expectation,</hi> there cannot poſſible be any <hi>hope</hi> there.</p>
                  <p>Therefore here is the Uſe we are to make of the point, that as the Angells are in <hi>expectation,</hi> and live by <hi>hope,</hi> ſo we ſhould labour to put in this <hi>drop</hi> of Balſome into all our <hi>comforts,</hi> to know that our life is a life of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi> and much more of <hi>expectation</hi> then the <hi>Angells;</hi> they are in <hi>fruition,</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> bliſſe, there are onely ſome <hi>acceſſories</hi> to be accompliſhed for them, yet they live by hope: If they live by hope in <hi>Viſion,</hi> ſhall not we much more that are in the ſtate of <hi>mortality,</hi> and <hi>breath</hi> after fruition? But this is the very ground of the Angells <hi>deſire,</hi> and inſpection into theſe Myſteries, <hi>hope,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, becauſe they are in <hi>expectation</hi> of the <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment</hi> of the reſt that God will fullfill the remnant of the <hi>Elect,</hi> and the remainder of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> that are not yet fullfilled. This is that that breeds <hi>inſpection,</hi> this is the ſecond true ground from expectation.</p>
                  <p>The third ground, or <hi>Radix</hi> whence this deſire comes, it is from <hi>contentation,</hi> whereas in humane things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation makes deſire to <hi>ceaſe,</hi> in <hi>celeſtiall</hi> things it <hi>increaſeth</hi> deſire, and from contentation they deſire to
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:114893:284"/>

                  <p>I joine theſe two together, leaſt any man ſhould have miſtaken the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Angelicall</hi> deſire, how it ſtands; and though this deſire be a bar to <hi>contentation,</hi> when we underſtand, and conceive of deſire that comes from <hi>want,</hi> we are onely to <hi>limit</hi> it to <hi>humane</hi> things, ſo St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> defines deſire; it is a <hi>longing</hi> after thoſe things that we have <hi>not,</hi> no man <hi>deſireth</hi> that that he <hi>hath,</hi> when he comes to <hi>fruition</hi> deſire <hi>ceaſeth;</hi> but <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſhews well by a good diſtinction, how <hi>deſire</hi> may well ſtand with <hi>contentation,</hi> and fruition, <hi>Deſiderium habendum, &amp;c. Deſire</hi> of things that we have <hi>not,</hi> that we may have it, that argues <hi>want,</hi> but deſire of the things that we <hi>have</hi> already, that it may be <hi>continued,</hi> that argues not a <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> and want; ſo the Appetite, and <hi>deſire</hi> of the Angells, what is it? not of <hi>want,</hi> but <hi>complacency,</hi> not an Appetite, and deſire of <hi>more,</hi> but a deſire of the <hi>continuance</hi> of that they have; there is <hi>deſire,</hi> and there is <hi>fruition;</hi> in their <hi>ſaciety,</hi> there is no <hi>dſtiaſt,</hi> and in their <hi>deſire,</hi> there is no <hi>want,</hi> ſayth <hi>Gregory</hi> well.</p>
                  <p>So now it ſhews us the excellent, <hi>beatificall</hi> eſtate in Heaven, in what it <hi>conſiſts,</hi> in that glory and joy there ſhall be <hi>fullneſſe,</hi> and yet <hi>deſire,</hi> there ſhall be the <hi>fruition</hi> of all good things promiſed, and yet an earneſt longing after the <hi>continuation</hi> of it. <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſets it out ſweetly, there ſhall be <hi>thirſt</hi> in Heaven, and <hi>ſaciety.</hi> A man would wonder that there ſhould be <hi>thirſt</hi> in Heaven, yes, ſayth he, the Saints ſhall alway be <hi>full,</hi> and ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

                  <p>One reaſon of their joy, is a reſpect they have to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> they rejoyce in the Myſteries of <hi>Salvation,</hi> becauſe <hi>they</hi> have the <hi>benefite</hi> of them, the benefite of Chriſts <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorious</hi> work extends to <hi>Angells.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews plainly, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>It pleaſed God to recapitulate, or gather to one, to ſum up to one all things, both things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and things in Earth;</hi> that is, <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>Angells:</hi> The Apoſtle ſhews it more plainly, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. <hi>It pleaſed him by the blood of his Croſſe, to reconcile to himſelfe, the things in Heaven, and things in Earth:</hi> to reconcile to himſelfe, Chriſt is a Medium of reconciliation to <hi>Angells,</hi> how is it to be underſtood? <hi>To reconcile to himſelfe things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and things in Earth,</hi> that is, <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>Angells.</hi> For howſoever, if <hi>reconciliation</hi> be <hi>properly</hi> taken, it is onely underſtood of <hi>men</hi> that fell, thoſe that were <hi>out</hi> of Gods favour, were onely <hi>reconciled;</hi> reconciliation is a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the <hi>favour</hi> of God; thoſe are ſaid to be brought into Gods <hi>favour</hi> that were <hi>out</hi> of it, <hi>man</hi> was out of it by <hi>ſin,</hi> therefore properly it belongs to <hi>man,</hi> but <hi>analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> it extends to <hi>Angells,</hi> their <hi>confirmation</hi> is to them as <hi>reconciliation,</hi> they are <hi>confirmed</hi> in the <hi>favour</hi> of God, and in a <hi>beatificall</hi> Viſion, and in <hi>glory, confirmation</hi> to them is as <hi>reconciliation</hi> to us, therfore the Apoſtle joyns both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one word, <hi>To reconcile all things to himſelfe, things in Heaven, and things in Earth,</hi> that is, <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>Angells.</hi> Therefore they deſire to look into the Doctrine of <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,</hi>
                     <pb n="536" facs="tcp:114893:286"/>they have <hi>benefite</hi> by it: Therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. he calls them <hi>Elect</hi> Angells, now <hi>Election</hi> is in Chriſt, in that he calls them <hi>Elect</hi> Angells, it is plain that their confirmation in this glory, is in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Chriſt works it; hence it is, that, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 2. the Apoſtle calls Chriſt, <hi>the head of principallities and powers.</hi> If Chriſt be the <hi>head,</hi> then the <hi>Angells</hi> muſt needs be ſuppoſed to be part of the <hi>body;</hi> if they be part of the <hi>body,</hi> then the other part is <hi>man; men,</hi> and <hi>Angells</hi> make up the <hi>tryumphant</hi> body, the <hi>myſticall</hi> body of Chriſt, and Chriſt is the <hi>head</hi> of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="537" facs="tcp:114893:286"/>
                  <p>Secondly, that is not all, for as their inſpection comes from <hi>joy</hi> in their <hi>owne</hi> happineſſe; ſo, ſecondly, from the abundance of <hi>joy,</hi> that they conceive of <hi>our</hi> happineſſe, becauſe <hi>we</hi> are taken into their fellowſhip; whereas a <hi>gap</hi> was in the order of <hi>Angells,</hi> now in the converſion of a <hi>Sinner,</hi> they rejoyce that he is brought in to make up that <hi>gap,</hi> for the making up of the <hi>tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> body, that was without an <hi>Arme</hi> till ſupply be made by the Salvation of <hi>men;</hi> and that they may ſhew they <hi>rejoyce</hi> abundantly in the Salvation of <hi>man,</hi> as well as their <hi>owne,</hi> they diſdaine not therefore, that men ſhould be accounted their <hi>fellow</hi>-heirs, and to be <hi>Keepers</hi> of the Saints, and miniſter to them, becauſe they know they are <hi>fallen</hi> Members brought into the <hi>ſame</hi> beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

                  <p>The Uſe that we are to make of it, is this; if there be ſuch <hi>joy</hi> in Angells that are in theſe Myſteries, that are in the <hi>fruition</hi> of them; it ſhould ſtir us up if <hi>they</hi> rejoyce for <hi>us,</hi> let <hi>us</hi> for our <hi>ſelves;</hi> we are nearer our <hi>ſelves</hi> then any <hi>other,</hi> let us <hi>imitate</hi> them; we cannot have a <hi>better</hi> patterne, they are <hi>confirmed</hi> in grace.
